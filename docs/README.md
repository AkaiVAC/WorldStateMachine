# World State Machine

These documents describe the world state constraint engine, its current implementation status, and the architectural roadmap that guides future milestones. Use this map to find the right level of detail quickly, from high-level vision to deep architectural references.

The docs are organized by core architecture, future design, reference materials, and research notes. Each section below links to the most relevant entry points with short summaries.

## Getting Started

- [vision.md](vision.md) - Full end-state vision for the constraint engine and its core pillars.
- [current.md](current.md) - Current implementation status and what is working today (extension bootstrap now active).
- [roadmap.md](roadmap.md) - Milestone-by-milestone path from M1 through M11.
- [decisions.md](decisions.md) - Design rationale and key architectural choices.
- [requirements/README.md](requirements/README.md) - Requirements overview for constraints and extension systems.

## Architecture

- [architecture/README.md](architecture/README.md) - Architecture hub with core, future, and reference sections.
- [architecture/core/README.md](architecture/core/README.md) - Current core architecture documents.
- [architecture/future/README.md](architecture/future/README.md) - Planned architecture documents for future milestones.
- [architecture/reference/README.md](architecture/reference/README.md) - Research, comparisons, and open questions.

## Notes and Research
