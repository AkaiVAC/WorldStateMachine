# Roadmap: From Current to Vision

**Last updated:** 2025-12-30
**Current position:** M4 complete, ready for M5
**Estimated timeline:** 5-7 months to full vision
**Proof-of-concept target:** M6 (epistemic state + multi-agent)

---

## Architectural Foundation: Fact-Based Runtime Model

**Key Insight (2025-12-30):** The lorebook is an *import format*, not the runtime model.

### The Problem with Keyword Matching

Lorebook entries are prose blobs matched by keywords. This causes:
- **Name collisions**: "Elara" the student triggers Queen Elara's entry
- **No disambiguation**: Can't distinguish entities with same name
- **No structure**: Prose isn't queryable
- **No temporal awareness**: Static text, no "when" information

### The Solution: Entity IDs + Structured Facts

```
LOREBOOK (Import)              RUNTIME MODEL
┌─────────────────┐            ┌─────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Prose blob with │   ──ETL──► │ Entity: elara-sunnaria-queen        │
│ keywords        │            │   displayName: "Elara"              │
│ "Queen Elara    │            │   facts:                            │
│  rules with..." │            │     - { attr: "title", val: "Queen" }│
└─────────────────┘            │     - { attr: "spouse", val: "alaric" }│
                               │   relationships:                     │
                               │     - { type: "rules", to: "sunnaria" }│
                               └─────────────────────────────────────┘
```

**Benefits:**
1. **No collisions**: Different entities have different IDs
2. **Structured queries**: "What facts does entity X know?"
3. **Temporal bounds**: Facts have validFrom/validTo
4. **True epistemic isolation**: Knowledge is per-entity-ID, not per-keyword

**Implications for Retrieval:**
- OLD: "Elara" in text → keyword search → inject matching prose
- NEW: Entity ID in scene → query facts for that entity → construct context

**Implications for Scene Setup:**
- Entities in a scene are identified by ID (or unambiguous reference)
- New entities (not in lorebook) get fresh IDs
- The LLM/author maintains entity→ID bindings within a session

**This enables M5 (Epistemic State):**
- `getKnowledge(entityId, timestamp)` → facts this entity knows
- No ambiguity about "which Elara"
- Clean foundation for multi-agent (M6)

## Milestone Sequencing Strategy

**Priority:** Realistic character knowledge first (epistemic state + multi-agent orchestration), then physical constraints (geography, travel), then advanced features.

**Critical path to proof-of-concept:**
1. M2: Relationship Graph (foundation)
2. M3: Timeline Foundation (temporal ordering)
3. M4: Events (track "who was there")
4. M5: Epistemic State ⭐ **FIRST BIG WIN**
5. M6: Multi-Agent Orchestration ⭐ **PROOF-OF-CONCEPT COMPLETE**

**After proof-of-concept:** Add physical constraints, then richness.

## Phase 1: Character Knowledge (M2-M6)

**Goal:** Enable realistic character knowledge boundaries in roleplay scenarios.

### M2: Relationship Graph ✅ DONE

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks

**Goal:** Add relationships between entities and enable graph traversal for context retrieval.

**What to build:**
- `Relationship` type: `{from: entityId, type: RelationType, to: entityId}`
- Relationship types: `daughter-of`, `son-of`, `rules`, `member-of`, `located-in`, etc.
- `RelationshipStore` with bidirectional queries
- Graph traversal: "Sunnaria" → `rules` → "Alaric", `member-of` → "Royal Family" → "Aradia"
- Integration with context retrieval

**Deliverables:**
- `src/world-state/relationship/relationship.ts` - Relationship type
- `src/world-state/relationship/relationship-store.ts` - Store and query
- `src/world-state/relationship/relationship-store.test.ts` - Tests
- `src/retrieval/graph-traversal.ts` - Context retrieval via graph
- `src/retrieval/graph-traversal.test.ts` - Tests

**Test cases (ZOMBIES):**
- Zero: Query entity with no relationships
- One: Single relationship lookup
- Many: Multiple relationships, multi-hop traversal
- Boundary: Circular relationships, deep graphs
- Interface: API ergonomics
- Exceptions: Unknown entity IDs
- Simple: "Sunnaria" → "Princess Aradia" via graph

**Success criteria:**
- User prompt: "Sunnarian Princess Comedy"
- Entity extraction: "Sunnarian" + "Princess"
- Graph traversal: "Sunnaria" → Royal Family → Aradia
- Context injection: ✅ Princess Aradia entry included

**Enables:** Better context injection, foundation for epistemic state

**Detailed design:** See `architecture/core/04-containment.md` (containment is a type of relationship)

### M3: Timeline Foundation ✅ DONE

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 weeks

**Goal:** Add temporal ordering to facts (chapter-based chronology).

**What to build:**
- Add `timestamp` field to `Fact` type (string: "Chapter 1", "Chapter 5", etc.)
- Add `validFrom` and `validTo` fields (nullable timestamps)
- Update `FactStore` to support temporal queries
- `getFactsAt(timestamp)` - query what was true at a specific time
- Chapter-based timeline (simple chronology)

**Deliverables:**
- Update `src/world-state/fact/fact.ts` - Add temporal fields
- Update `src/world-state/fact/fact-store.ts` - Temporal queries
- Update `src/world-state/fact/fact-store.test.ts` - Temporal test cases

**Test cases:**

- Query at Chapter 3: returns fact
- Query at Chapter 6: doesn't return fact
- Fact with validFrom but no validTo (still valid)
- Overlapping facts (conflict detection)

**Success criteria:**
- Can track "Alaric is King" from Chapter 1 onward
- Can track "Alaric is King" from Chapter 1 to Chapter 10 (then dies)
- Query "What was Alaric's title at Chapter 5?" → "King"

**Enables:** Events with temporal bounds, historical queries

**Detailed design:** See `architecture/core/02-timeline-centric.md`

---

### M4: Events as Source of Truth ✅ DONE

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks

**Goal:** Track events that generate facts, record participation, preserve original prose.

**What was built:**
- `Event` type: id, worldId, timestamp, title, location, participants, visibility, outcomes, prose
- `EventStore` with queries by participant, timestamp, location, visibility
- Fact generation from events (`getFactsFromEvent`)
- Visibility levels: private, restricted, public
- 30 tests passing

  worldId: string;
  timestamp: number;          // numeric timestamp
  title: string;              // "Secret War Council"
  location?: string;          // Entity ID for location
  participants: string[];     // Entity IDs
  visibility: Visibility;     // "private" | "restricted" | "public"
  outcomes?: Fact[];          // Facts extracted from this event
  prose?: string;             // Original prose
};
```

**Enables:** Epistemic state (who was at which events)

**Detailed design:** See `architecture/core/02-timeline-centric.md` §2.2, `architecture/core/08-epistemic-state.md`

---

### M5: Epistemic State ⭐ FIRST BIG WIN

**Estimated effort:** 4-5 weeks

**Goal:** Track what each character knows based on event participation and visibility. Enable POV-filtered context retrieval. **Requires Fact-based runtime model.**

**Prerequisite: Lorebook → Entity/Fact ETL**

Before epistemic queries work, we need structured data:

1. **Entity extraction from lorebook**
   - Parse lorebook entries
   - Identify entities (characters, locations, factions)
   - Assign unique entity IDs
   - Extract `displayName` as an attribute

2. **Fact extraction from prose**
   - Parse lorebook content into structured facts
   - `{ subject: entityId, attribute: "title", value: "Queen" }`
   - Attach temporal bounds where inferrable

3. **Relationship extraction**
   - Identify relationships from prose ("wife of", "rules", "located in")
   - Store as structured relationships with entity IDs

**What to build:**
- **Lorebook ETL pipeline**: `lorebookToEntities(lorebook) → Entity[]`
- **Fact extraction**: `extractFacts(entity, prose) → Fact[]`
- Knowledge queries: `getKnowledge(entityId, timestamp)` → events + facts they know
- Participation-based knowledge (if you were there, you know)
- Visibility-based knowledge (public events, court events, group events)
- `reveals` mechanism (learning about past events)
- `concealedFrom` mechanism (explicitly hiding from someone)
- POV-filtered context retrieval

**Deliverables:**
- `src/import/lorebook-etl.ts` - Lorebook → Entity/Fact extraction
- `src/import/lorebook-etl.test.ts` - ETL tests
- `src/world-state/entity/entity.ts` - Entity type with ID
- `src/world-state/epistemic/knowledge-query.ts` - Knowledge retrieval
- `src/world-state/epistemic/knowledge-query.test.ts` - Tests
- `src/retrieval/pov-filter.ts` - POV-filtered context for LLM
- `src/retrieval/pov-filter.test.ts` - Tests

**Test cases:**
- Character participated in event → knows about it
- Character didn't participate, event is public → knows about it
- Character didn't participate, event is private → doesn't know
- Event reveals prior event → character learns about past
- Event concealed-from character → doesn't know even if public

**Success criteria:**
- Event 1: "Secret War Council" (Chapter 5, private, participants: [King, General])
- Event 2: "Ball" (Chapter 5, public)
- Query: "What does Princess Aradia know at Chapter 6?"
  - ✅ Includes Ball (public)
  - ❌ Doesn't include War Council (private, she wasn't there)
- Generate scene from Aradia's POV → LLM context doesn't include War Council

**Enables:** Multi-agent orchestration, realistic roleplay

**Detailed design:** See `architecture/core/08-epistemic-state.md`

---

### M6: Multi-Agent Orchestration ⭐ PROOF-OF-CONCEPT COMPLETE

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks

**Goal:** Generate scenes with multiple characters who have different knowledge. Each character gets POV-filtered context.

**What to build:**
- Multi-agent scene setup (multiple characters, each with POV context)
- Orchestrated dialogue generation (character A speaks, character B responds)
- Knowledge tracking during scene (if A reveals X to B, update B's knowledge)
- Merge individual outputs into coherent scene
- UI for multi-agent scene setup

**Deliverables:**
- `src/scene/multi-agent.ts` - Multi-agent orchestration
- `src/scene/multi-agent.test.ts` - Tests
- `src/ui/routes/scene.ts` - Scene setup UI
- Integration with epistemic state

**Test cases:**
- Two-character scene, both know same information → normal dialogue
- Two-character scene, A knows secret, B doesn't → A's context includes secret, B's doesn't
- During dialogue, A reveals secret to B → B's context updated
- Three-character scene with mixed knowledge

**Success criteria:**
- Scene: King Alaric and Princess Aradia discuss the war (Chapter 6)
- King knows: Secret war council decision (attack from north)
- Aradia knows: War started (public knowledge), but not strategy
- System generates:
  - King's dialogue with full context (including secret)
  - Aradia's dialogue with limited context (no secret)
  - LLM for King can reference strategy, LLM for Aradia cannot
- If King mentions "northern strategy" in dialogue → system flags as "revealed to Aradia"

**Enables:** Realistic roleplay with secrets, complex multi-character scenes

**Proof-of-concept target:** If this works, the core vision is validated.

**Detailed design:** See `architecture/core/09-scene-execution.md` §9.3-9.4

- Proximity queries ("what's near X?")
- Location context for scenes

**Deliverables:**
- `src/world-state/geography/location.ts`
- `src/world-state/geography/containment.ts`
- Tests

**Success criteria:**
- "Royal Gardens" is `part-of` "Sunnaria"
- Query "What's in Sunnaria?" → [Palace, Royal Gardens, Market District, ...]
- Scene in Royal Gardens → context includes Sunnaria

**Enables:** Travel validation

**Detailed design:** See `architecture/core/04-containment.md`

---

### M8: Travel Validation

**Estimated effort:** 1-2 weeks

**Goal:** Routes between locations, travel time validation. Characters can't teleport.

**What to build:**
- `Route` type: from/to locations, travel time
- Travel time calculation
- Validation rule: "Can character X be at location Y at timestamp Z?"

**Deliverables:**
- `src/world-state/geography/route.ts`
- `src/validation/travel-rule.ts`
- Tests

**Success criteria:**
- Route: Sunnaria ↔ Ilaria (7 days)
- Aradia in Sunnaria at Chapter 5, Day 1
- Aradia in Ilaria at Chapter 5, Day 9
- Validation: ✅ (7 days + margin, plausible)
- Aradia in Ilaria at Chapter 5, Day 3
- Validation: ❌ (only 2 days, impossible)

**Enables:** Spatial consistency constraints

**Detailed design:** See `architecture/core/16-map-spatial-system.md` §16.7

---

**What to build:**
- 2D coordinates for locations
- Terrain types (plains, mountains, forest, etc.)
- Weather system (per location, per timestamp)
- Advanced route calculation (terrain affects travel time)
- Map visualization (optional)

**Deliverables:**
- `src/world-state/map/coordinates.ts`
- `src/world-state/map/terrain.ts`
- `src/world-state/map/weather.ts`
- Tests

**Success criteria:**
- Locations have (x, y) coordinates
- Route calculation considers terrain (mountains slower than plains)
- Weather at location/timestamp ("Sunnaria, Chapter 5, Day 3" → "Rainy")
- Context injection includes weather/terrain

**Detailed design:** See `architecture/core/16-map-spatial-system.md`

---

### M10: Calendar System

**Estimated effort:** 2-3 weeks

**Goal:** Full temporal granularity (year → season → month → day → hour).

**What to build:**
- Calendar structure (epochs, eras, years, seasons, months, days, hours)
- Custom calendar support (configurable per world)
- Time-of-day and seasonal constraints
- Temporal math (duration, interval, comparison)

**Deliverables:**
- `src/world-state/calendar/calendar.ts`
- `src/world-state/calendar/timestamp.ts`
- Tests

**Success criteria:**
- Define custom calendar (12 months, 30 days each, 4 seasons)
- Timestamps have full granularity: "Year 20, Summer, Month 3, Day 15, Hour 14"
- Constraints: "Can't farm in winter" (season check)
- Context: "It's night, the market is closed" (time-of-day check)

**Detailed design:** See `architecture/core/15-calendar-time-system.md`

---

### M11: Effect Propagation

**Estimated effort:** 3-4 weeks

**Goal:** Cascading effects, LLM-generated possibility branches, ambient generation.

**What to build:**
- Effect identification (which entities affected by event?)
- Relationship-based propagation ("flows-through", "depends-on", etc.)
- LLM-generated effect branches with probabilities
- Author/dice selection of branch
- Recursive effect propagation (with checkpoints)
- Ambient generation (background events within constraints)

**Deliverables:**
- `src/world-state/effects/propagation.ts`
- `src/world-state/effects/branches.ts`
- `src/scene/ambient.ts`
- Tests

**Success criteria:**
- Event: "Dam built on Great River"
- System identifies affected: Downstream kingdoms (via `flows-through` relationships)
- LLM generates branches:
  - A: Catastrophic flooding (30%)
  - B: Controlled flow (50%)
  - C: Improved irrigation (20%)
- Author selects branch B
- Effects become facts: Diplomatic tension increases, but manageable

**Detailed design:** See `architecture/core/03-effects.md`, `architecture/core/09-scene-execution.md` §9.5-9.6

## Evaluation Points

### After M6 (Proof-of-Concept) - CRITICAL DECISION POINT

**Test scenarios:**
1. Secret war council (3 characters know, Princess doesn't)
2. Later scene where Princess talks to King
3. Does LLM respect knowledge constraint?

**Evaluate:**
- Does epistemic isolation work?
- Does multi-agent feel natural?
- Is validation catching mistakes?
- Is the system worth continuing?

**Decisions:**
- ✅ If successful: Continue to M7-M11
- ⚠️ If mixed: Adjust approach, iterate on M5-M6
- ❌ If unsuccessful: Pivot architecture or tooling

### After M8 (Physical Constraints)

**Test:** Travel validation working?
- Character movement makes sense?
- No teleporting?

**Evaluate:** Is spatial validation adding value?

### After M11 (Full Vision)

**Test:** Full constraint package working?
- All three pillars (Timeline, Map, Calendar)?
- LLM generating world-consistent prose?

**Evaluate:** Production-ready?

## Future Features (Post-M11)

### Anticipatory Context Injection

**Problem:** If a scene is *leading toward* a topic (e.g., trade negotiations about tariffs) without explicitly mentioning it, how can we preemptively inject relevant context?

**Potential approaches:**

1. **Scene Classification**
   - LLM analyzes conversation trajectory: "This looks like a diplomatic scene building toward trade discussion"
   - Pre-inject trade/economic entries before they're explicitly mentioned

2. **Topic Momentum Tracking**
   - Track topic mentions across conversation history
   - When a topic gains momentum (multiple related mentions), anticipate and inject

3. **Narrative Arc Templates**
   - Define common story beats: "Diplomatic meeting" → likely leads to treaties, trade, alliances
   - Pre-inject related context based on scene type

**Status:** Deferred. Requires conversation history analysis and scene classification. Consider after M6.

---

## Next Steps

**Immediate:** Start M5 (Epistemic State)

1. Design `getKnowledge(characterId, timestamp)` query interface
2. Implement participation-based knowledge (if you were there, you know)
3. Implement visibility-based knowledge (public vs private events)
4. Apply ZOMBIES, write `test.todo()` cases
5. Create POV-filtered context retrieval
