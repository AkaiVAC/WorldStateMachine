## What's Missing (From Vision) ❌

### Timeline System ✅ M3 COMPLETE
- ✅ Temporal bounds (validFrom/validTo) on facts
- ✅ Temporal queries ("what was true at timestamp 5?")
- ❌ Transaction time (undo/audit)

### Events ✅ M4 COMPLETE
- ✅ Events as source of truth
- ✅ Participation tracking (query by participant)
- ✅ Visibility levels (private/restricted/public)

- ✅ Integrated into chat context retrieval pipeline
- ✅ World summary prevents kingdom invention

### Geography System
- ❌ Containment hierarchy (X is in Y)
- ❌ 2D coordinates
- ❌ Routes and travel time
- ❌ Spatial validation
- ❌ Terrain and weather

### Epistemic State
- ❌ POV-filtered context

## Current Status (From Testing)

**M4 Complete + Graph Integrated:** Event system and context retrieval working together

**What works now:**
- ✅ "Sunnarian" → Entity extraction → Fuzzy match → Sunnaria kingdom entry injected
- ✅ Graph traversal expands matches: Sunnaria → Alaric, Aradia, Elara
- ✅ World summary in system prompt prevents kingdom invention
- ✅ Events with participants, locations, visibility levels
- ✅ Fact generation from events with temporal bounds
- ✅ Related entries marked as "related" in injected entries

**Next milestone:** M5 - Epistemic State (POV-filtered knowledge, "what does X know?")

## Tech Stack

- **Runtime:** Bun
- **Language:** TypeScript (strict mode)
- **Testing:** Bun test (114 tests)
- **Linting/Formatting:** Biome
- **LLM:** OpenRouter API (configurable model)
- **Frontend:** Vanilla JS/TS (no framework)

---

## Dev Workflow

**Test:** `bun test`
**Lint/Format:** `bun run check`

**Rules:**
- TDD mandatory (failing test → minimum code → refactor)
- No comments (self-documenting code)
- One step at a time
- Ask before large changes

See `CLAUDE.md` for full development guidelines.

---

## Gap Analysis

**From M2 (current) to Vision:**
- M1+M2 provide basic validation, context injection, and relationship graphs
- Missing timeline (M3), epistemic state (M5), multi-agent (M6), maps (M7-M9)
- Chat UI exists but context injection needs graph integration

**Next step:** M4 (Events) - see `roadmap.md`

---

## Known Issues

1. ~~**Relationship graph not integrated**~~ - ✅ Fixed: Graph traversal wired into context retrieval
2. ~~**LLM invents kingdoms**~~ - ✅ Fixed: `constant` entries (world overview) always injected
3. **No fact extraction from LLM output** - Loop isn't closed (generate → extract → commit)
4. ~~**Name collisions in keyword matching**~~ - ✅ Resolved by design: Entity IDs replace keyword matching (see below)

---

## Architectural Insight (2025-12-30)

**Key realization:** The lorebook is an *import format*, not the runtime model.

**Problem:** Keyword matching "Elara" can't distinguish Queen Elara from a student named Elara. Secondary keys, corroborating evidence, and other patches are brittle - they fundamentally can't solve disambiguation when two entities with the same name appear in the same scene.

**Solution:** Transform lorebook into structured data:
- **Entities** with unique IDs (not names)
- **Facts** with subject=entityId (structured, queryable, temporal)
- **Relationships** linking entity IDs

**Implications for M5:**
- M5 now includes lorebook ETL as prerequisite
- `getKnowledge(entityId, timestamp)` queries by ID, not name
- Scene setup binds display names to entity IDs
- New characters get fresh IDs (no collision with existing entities)
- True epistemic isolation becomes possible

## Summary

**M4 is complete.** Event system and context retrieval fully integrated:
- Event type with id, timestamp, title, location, participants, visibility, outcomes, prose
- EventStore with queries by participant, timestamp, location, visibility
- Fact generation from events (outcomes → facts with validFrom from event timestamp)
- Visibility levels: private, restricted, public
- Graph traversal expansion integrated into chat context pipeline
- `constant` lorebook entries (like world overview) always injected
- 6 new E2E tests for complex story scenarios (diplomatic meetings, trade, multi-kingdom)

**What works:** Basic validation, context injection (keyword + entity + graph expansion), relationship graphs, temporal facts, events, constant entries, chat UI.

**What's missing:** Epistemic state (M5), multi-agent (M6), maps (M7-M9).

**Next:** M5 - Epistemic State + Tool-Calling Architecture (major architectural shift)

**Architectural Pivots (2025-12-31 / 2026-01-01):**

The M5 and M11 designs have been significantly expanded based on insights about world state management:

1. **World State as RPG Stats:** All entities (characters, kingdoms, economies, weather) have queryable numeric attributes. No hardcoded schemas - facts are arbitrary key-value pairs that adapt to any world.

2. **Tool-Calling Over Context-Stuffing:** LLMs query facts via tools rather than receiving massive context packages. This ensures deterministic values (grain-tariff is exactly 0.15, not "approximately 15%") and prevents hallucination.

3. **Characters Are RPG Stat Sheets:** Characters get comprehensive state extraction across ALL attributes:
   - Physical: height, strength, age, health, stamina
   - Equipment: shoe condition, tunic color, sword state
   - Appearance: clothing color, visible injuries, hair style
   - Conditions: wetness, exhaustion, poisoned, blessed
   - Social: attitudes, mood, trust levels
   - Skills: combat, magic, knowledge domains

   **Example:** "I was wearing red" stays red across scenes. Damaged shoe affects mud navigation. Height affects reach constraints.

4. **Unified World Tick:** ALL entities simulate forward every timestamp at varying detail levels:
   - **Tier 1 (Focus):** Full prose scenes for current protagonists
   - **Tier 2 (Intentional):** State changes + summaries for off-screen active characters (Aradia fighting necromancer)
   - **Tier 3 (Passive):** Minimal drift for background NPCs (location, routine)
   - **Tier 4 (System):** Automatic updates for economies, weather, kingdoms

   **Result:** World always ticks. Off-screen characters continue to exist and act. No freeze problem. Seamless focus shifts.

5. **Hybrid Persistence:** SQLite for runtime queries + JSON snapshots for human-readable backups. Fast, scalable, inspectable.

6. **Comprehensive ETL:** Extract ALL measurable attributes from lorebook prose, including inferred values. "Thriving economy" → trade-volume: 8500. All entities in a category get same schema.

## Recent Changes (2026-01-01)

### **Code Quality Cleanup**

**Removed dead code:**
- `validate-prompt.ts` - Standalone demo script, functionality covered by tests
- `markdown.test.ts` - Tested external library, not our code
- `entity-view.ts` + tests - Unused utility

**Results:**
- Tests: 192 passing (down from 204, removed 12 redundant tests)
- Cleaner codebase, no unused code

### **Extension Architecture Decision** 🎯

**Major architectural pivot:** Moving from traditional monolithic structure to **plugin-first architecture**.

**Key decisions:**
1. **Everything is an extension** - Including core functionality
2. **Zero codebase changes** to add features - Drop extension folder, restart
3. **Lifecycle hooks** - Extensions can intercept before/after any operation
4. **Extensible stores** - Even timeline storage is pluggable
5. **Auto-discovery** - No manual registration needed
6. **Readable directory names** - `load-world-data/`, `validate-consistency/`, etc.

**See [NEXT_SESSION.md](NEXT_SESSION.md) for complete implementation plan.**

```

**Impact:**
- Future features = new extensions (no core changes)
- Users can replace any component (with validation)
- Clean separation of concerns
- VS Code-level extensibility
