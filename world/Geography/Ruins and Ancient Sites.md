# Ruins and Ancient Sites

Scattered throughout Excelsia lie ruins of earlier civilizations, offering glimpses into lost cultures and potential sources of ancient knowledge or treasure. Sunken Meridian temples dot southern coastlines, accessible only during low tides or through diving. Crystal Peak observatories in high mountains contain advanced astronomical knowledge and sometimes still-functional magical devices. Whispering Woods stone circles in ancient forests serve as focal points for natural magic and fey interactions. These sites attract archaeologists, treasure hunters, and mages seeking forgotten power. However, ruins often contain magical protections, cursed treasures, or dangerous creatures that have taken up residence. Legal ownership of discoveries remains contentious, with kingdoms claiming rights to artifacts found within their borders while adventurers argue for finder's rights. Some ruins have been partially restored as historical sites or repurposed for modern use, while others remain dangerous and largely unexplored due to their remote locations or powerful protective magic.
