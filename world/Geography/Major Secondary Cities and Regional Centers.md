# Major Secondary Cities and Regional Centers

Beyond capitals, numerous secondary cities serve as regional administration centers and economic hubs. River-crossing towns along Sunnaria's trade routes generate substantial toll revenues and host merchant quarters from multiple kingdoms. Limaria's fortress-cities guard strategic passes and train regional military forces. Lindward's gem-mining cities extract wealth from mountain veins while maintaining luxurious lifestyles. Stuttgart's mining towns operate round-the-clock extracting precious metals and minerals. Ilaria's temple-cities combine religious devotion with magical research in isolated sanctums. Lunaria's port cities handle maritime trade while maintaining naval readiness. These secondary centers often develop distinct cultural identities blending kingdom traditions with local influences. They serve as testing grounds for new policies and sometimes become power bases for ambitious nobles or merchants challenging central authority. The balance between capital control and regional autonomy varies by kingdom, with highly centralized systems like Limaria contrasting with more federated approaches like Zyronia's tribal confederation.
