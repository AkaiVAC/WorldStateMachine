# Excelsia Continental Overview

Excelsia is a medieval fantasy continent spanning approximately 3,000 kilometers east-west and 2,500 kilometers north-south, home to eight distinct kingdoms with a total population of around 40 million concentrated primarily in fertile river valleys, coastal plains, and temperate forests. Vast regions remain uninhabited wilderness—the Blighted Lands, deep mountain ranges, dense jungles, and northern tundra—accounting for nearly 60% of the continental landmass. Civilized settlement clusters along the Golden Rivers system, coastal regions, and protected mountain valleys, creating population densities of 30-50 people per square kilometer in settled areas while leaving enormous wilderness zones between kingdoms. The continent features diverse geography including mountain ranges, river systems, coastal regions, and varied climate zones from subarctic north to tropical south. Major geographic features include the Thunderpeak Mountains in the southwest, the Golden River delta system in the central region, and the Silverwood Forest in the northwest.
