# Diplomatic Protocols and Royal Etiquette

Complex diplomatic protocols govern interactions between kingdoms, designed to prevent offense and facilitate negotiation. Royal audiences follow strict hierarchies based on kingdom status, with the Three Great Kingdoms receiving precedence. Gift exchanges carry symbolic meaning, with inappropriate gifts potentially causing diplomatic incidents. Language use in formal diplomacy requires careful attention to titles, honorifics, and traditional formulas. Ceremonial dress follows kingdom-specific traditions while respecting host customs. Negotiation procedures include preliminary meetings, formal presentations, private discussions, and treaty signings with witnessed oaths. Conflict resolution typically involves neutral mediation, often by Sunnaria given its central position and diplomatic reputation. Breaches of protocol range from minor social awkwardness to serious insults requiring formal apology or compensation. Younger diplomats and royals receive extensive training in multiple kingdoms' customs to prevent unintentional offenses. These protocols have evolved over centuries of interaction, incorporating elements from all major cultures while maintaining distinct kingdom identities. Mastery of diplomatic etiquette represents a valuable skill for nobles and officials operating in international contexts.
