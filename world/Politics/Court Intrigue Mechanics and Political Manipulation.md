# Court Intrigue Mechanics and Political Manipulation

Royal courts host complex political games where nobles, officials, and foreign agents maneuver for influence, wealth, and power. Information represents the primary currency, with spies, informants, and intercepted communications providing advantage. Alliance-building involves marriage proposals, business partnerships, shared enemies, and mutual benefit arrangements. Reputation management requires careful balancing of apparent strength with approachability. Favor trading creates networks of obligation that can be called upon during crises. Scandal manufacturing discredits rivals through true or fabricated revelations. Succession positioning involves supporting or undermining potential heirs based on future calculations. Foreign intelligence operations gather information while sometimes manipulating local politics for external advantage. Magical influence includes divination for advantage, enchantment for manipulation, and protective wards against hostile magic. Successful court players master multiple skills: social charm, strategic thinking, information analysis, risk assessment, and sometimes combat or magical ability for self-protection. The most dangerous players appear harmless while wielding significant influence through subtle manipulation rather than overt power.
