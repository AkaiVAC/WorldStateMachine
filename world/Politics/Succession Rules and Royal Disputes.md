# Succession Rules and Royal Disputes

Royal succession follows kingdom-specific rules that balance hereditary claims with practical considerations. Most human kingdoms use primogeniture with variations: Sunnaria allows designation of competent heirs, Limaria considers military capability, Stuttgart incorporates meritocratic elements, and Lindward weighs economic skill. Ilaria's elven monarchy combines bloodline with magical attainment and council approval. Lunaria's matriarchal system passes the crown through female lines exclusively. Aeldrin's elven council selects rulers based on wisdom and magical harmony rather than strict heredity. Ironforge's dwarven throne follows clan leadership traditions. Zyronia's tribal confederation uses charismatic selection. Succession disputes represent ongoing political challenges, with current tensions in Lindward where King Michael's youth has led to the establishment of a Regent's Council including senior nobles and merchant guild leaders to ensure stability during his minority. Clear succession rules prevent conflicts, while ambiguous situations invite manipulation by internal factions and external powers. Royal families often maintain detailed genealogical records and succession plans, though unexpected deaths, disputed paternity, or sudden abdications can create instability. The Three Great Kingdoms Alliance sometimes mediates succession disputes to prevent wider conflicts.
