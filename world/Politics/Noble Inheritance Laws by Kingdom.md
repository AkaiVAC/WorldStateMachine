# Noble Inheritance Laws by Kingdom

Each kingdom maintains distinct inheritance systems reflecting cultural values and political needs. Sunnaria typically follows primogeniture with flexibility for demonstrated diplomatic or commercial ability. Limaria emphasizes martial capability, with inheritance sometimes passing to the most militarily competent child regardless of birth order. Stuttgart's meritocratic system allows rulers to designate successors based on achievement rather than bloodline alone. Ilaria's elven nobility considers both lineage and magical attainment over centuries-long perspectives. Lunaria's matriarchal system passes all property and titles through female lines exclusively. Lindward often sees inheritance determined by business acumen and wealth management skills. Aeldrin's elven council system balances hereditary claims with demonstrated wisdom and magical harmony. Ironforge's dwarven clans use complex systems considering craft mastery, clan loyalty, and traditional rights. Zyronia's tribal confederation typically follows charismatic leadership and demonstrated ability to maintain tribal harmony. These systems create different succession dynamics, with some kingdoms experiencing stable transitions while others face frequent disputes or require royal intervention to resolve inheritance conflicts.
