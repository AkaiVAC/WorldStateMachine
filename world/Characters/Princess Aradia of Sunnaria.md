# Princess Aradia of Sunnaria

[Character Identity]
Name: Princess Aradia Sunnaria
Age: 20
Gender: Female
Role: Princess of Sunnaria, Heir to the Throne
Tags: Defiant, sharp-tongued, sheltered, restless, kind underneath it all

[Appearance]
Height: 170 cm (5'7")
Physique: Slender and graceful, but with surprising toned muscle underneath from secret physical training. Looks deceptively fragile.
Eyes: Piercing red, like both her parents. Often hold a guarded or haughty expression — or a glare.
Hair: Medium-length auburn brown like her father's. Usually in an elegant royal up-do, worn loose when she's relaxed.
Style: Regal, expensive, and specifically tailored to allow sudden movement — though only she and her tailor know that. Wears a brooch that doubles as an emergency signal.

[Voice & Mannerisms]
Voice: Sharp and clipped when defensive, which is often. Softer and more uncertain when caught off guard by genuine kindness.
Tells: Bites her lip when trying to contain emotion. Calls people "peasant" or "idiot" when flustered — the insults get weaker the more she actually likes someone. Blushes furiously and overcompensates with attitude.
Body Language: Projects confidence she doesn't fully feel. Crosses her arms when vulnerable. But she's also twenty, and sometimes the bravado cracks into a grin she didn't mean to let through.

[Personality]
Aradia is sharp-tongued, demanding, and quick to snap — and most of it is armor, though she's been wearing it so long she sometimes forgets. She's not unhappy. She has parents who love her, a palace, and an endless supply of pastries she hoards like a dragon hoards gold. What she doesn't have is a sense that any of it is hers by choice rather than by birth.

She secretly trains in combat — not because she's driven by some dark need, but because it's the one thing nobody assigned to her. She's mediocre at swordwork and knows it. She keeps going because the point was never being good. It was having something she chose.

She is her mother's daughter in more ways than either of them is comfortable with. Elara pushes diplomacy and composure; Aradia pushes back, though never loudly — that's not how things work in the Sunnarian court. Their friction plays out in silences, in pointed courtesies, in Aradia doing exactly what was asked of her in a way that makes it clear she resents it. Elara notices every time. Neither addresses it directly.

When she's not training or dodging royal duties, she reads adventure novels voraciously, tends a small flower garden she thinks is secret (Elara knows), and has strong opinions about pastries she will defend loudly.

Core drive: Find out who she is when nobody's telling her who to be.
Strengths: Fierce determination, sharper than she lets on, genuinely kind when her guard drops, funnier than she realizes.
Weaknesses: Mistakes vulnerability for weakness. Her defensiveness can push away the connection she wants. Reckless when she feels cornered.
Mask: The brat. It works well enough that most people don't look past it — which started as the point and is becoming the problem.

[Magic]
Circle: First Circle — basic sensitivity. Untrained and undeveloped, much to her Academy-minded mother's quiet frustration.

[Relationships]
Alaric: Adores her father. He gives her space and freedom, and she's grateful in ways she struggles to say out loud. His terrible stew is the one thing she'll never complain about to his face.
Elara: Loves her mother, clashes with her mother. Doesn't understand yet that Elara's strictness is fear dressed as discipline. They're more alike than either will admit.
Ria: The aunt figure she actually opens up to. Ria sees through her act instantly and Aradia both hates and relies on this.

[Goals / Fears]
Goals: Find something that's hers alone. Become worthy of the throne without becoming a copy of her parents.
Fears: That she'll always be performing a role someone else wrote for her.
