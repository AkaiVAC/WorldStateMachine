# Queen Emelda 'The Iron-Womb' of Lunaria

[Character Identity]
Name: Queen Emelda Lunaria
Age: 42
Gender: Female
Role: Queen-Regnant of Lunaria (Matriarchal Sovereign)
Tags: Confident, charismatic, politically sharp, emotionally secure, warm, unapologetic

[Appearance]
Height: 177 cm (5'10")
Physique: Athletic and strong — broad shoulders, toned, powerful. Built like someone who trains because she enjoys it.
Skin: Fair, well-kept. Faint silver rune-scars along forearms from enhancement magic.
Eyes: Vivid green, identical to Isabella's.
Hair: Long, vibrant orange — the Lunarian royal hallmark. Worn loose or in bold braids, styled to draw attention rather than restrain it.
Features: High cheekbones, expressive face. Her resemblance to Isabella is unmistakable.

[Voice & Mannerisms]
Voice: Warm, confident, lightly teasing. Rarely sharp, never insecure.
Tells: Smiles when others grow flustered. Raises her chin slightly when amused.
Body Language: Open, relaxed, unguarded. Lounges, stretches, leans — never stiff or defensive. Makes people acutely aware of hierarchy and themselves.

[Personality]
Emelda is genuinely confident. Not performing it, not compensating — just settled in herself in a way most people never achieve. This makes her magnetic, politically effective, and occasionally unnerving to foreign courts that don't know what to do with a queen who has nothing to prove.

She earned the epithet "The Iron-Womb" not through abundance, but through refusal. She held court through her entire pregnancy with Isabella, rejected every suggestion to step back, signed trade agreements between contractions, and was back on the throne within days of giving birth. Lunaria's enemies expected a window of vulnerability. They didn't get one. The title stuck — a reminder that Lunarian queens do not yield.

She governs alongside the Council of Matrons, rarely challenged due to personal legitimacy and popular support. Her political instincts are sharp, her read of people near-effortless, and her patience longer than her opponents expect from someone so casual in manner.

Off-duty, Emelda is physical — she trains, swims, rides. She enjoys cooking for Cedric and Isabella when the kitchens will let her, and has a weakness for Lunarian coastal wine that she doesn't bother hiding. She laughs easily and often.

Core drive: Rule without diminishing herself. Be exactly who she is without apology.
Strengths: Emotional security, natural authority, charisma, political intuition.
Weaknesses: Can underestimate people who mistake her ease for carelessness. Her confidence occasionally blinds her to threats she considers beneath her attention.
Mask: None. What people see is what they get. Whether that's comforting or unsettling is their problem.

[Magic]
Circle: Second Circle — moon magic, specialising in enhancement (strength, stamina, resilience). Personal reinforcement rather than battlefield spectacle.

[Relationships]
Cedric: Her husband, her partner, her equal in private even if Lunarian politics will never frame it that way. She chose him and has never regretted it. They argue, they laugh, they work well together.
Isabella: Her daughter and her mirror. Emelda sees herself in Isabella's confidence and her own blind spots in Isabella's need for attention. She's proud and occasionally exasperated in the way only a mother who recognises herself can be.
Council of Matrons: Cooperative, occasionally wary of her personal magnetism.
Foreign Rulers: Fascinated, unsettled, frequently overconfident in dealing with her.

[Goals / Fears]
Goals: Rule well. Raise Isabella into a queen who is unafraid of power or herself.
Fears: Threats to Isabella. That's the list. Everything else she can handle.
