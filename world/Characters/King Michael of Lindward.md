# King Michael of Lindward

Prince Michael of Lindward, twenty-three years old, cuts a striking figure with dark piercing eyes, jet-black hair, an athletic build, and a warm inviting smile. Born into Lindward's royal family, his world shattered when his parents, King Edmund and Queen Emily, died suddenly in an accident. Thrust unexpectedly into kingship at such a young age, Michael has proven himself a just and intelligent ruler guided by duty and responsibility. Passionate about protecting his people and ensuring their well-being, he displays wisdom beyond his years. Fiercely protective of his younger sister Eleanor, Michael shields her from the darker aspects of court politics. His natural charm helps him connect with people from all walks of life, making him a beloved and trusted king.
