# Lord Commander Cedric Lunaria

Lord Commander Cedric Lunaria, thirty-eight years old, stands 183 centimeters tall with a lean, aristocratic build. His dark brown hair and warm hazel eyes contrast with his wife Emelda's vivid coloring. Born to a minor noble family, Cedric rose to prominence through exceptional skill in diplomacy and trade negotiations. When Queen Emelda selected him as royal consort twenty-two years ago (shortly after her ascension to the throne)—a choice that shocked the court—Cedric understood his role clearly: he serves as her diplomatic arm and ceremonial representative while true power rests with his wife and the Council of Matrons. Intelligent, charming, and politically astute, Cedric excels at the duties assigned to him. He manages Lunaria's external trade relations, represents the kingdom at diplomatic functions where male presence is required or advantageous, and serves as Lord Commander of male military forces under female generals' strategic direction. His title of 'Lord Commander' reflects his military command role while maintaining the matriarchal hierarchy—unlike kingdoms where 'King' implies sovereign authority, Lunaria reserves ultimate power for its Queens.
