# King Alerin Volczak of Ilaria

[Character Identity]
Name: King Alerin Volczak of Ilaria
Age: 200+ (appears late forties)
Gender: Male
Race: High Elf
Role: King of the Holy Ilarien Empire
Tags: Devout, patient, regal, formal, sincere, loving in ways he doesn't know how to show

[Appearance]
Height: 188 cm (6'2")
Physique: Imposing, regal bearing. Lean and strong in the way elves maintain — age doesn't diminish them so much as refine them.
Eyes: Azure blue, steady and ancient. Warm when he looks at Elestria, though she's never noticed.
Hair: Long blonde, immaculately groomed.
Features: Sculpted, ageless elven nobility. Handsome in a way that's difficult to relate to — too composed, too still.

[Voice & Mannerisms]
Voice: Calm, resonant, unhurried. Has never raised his voice in court. Has never needed to.
Tells: Closes his eyes briefly when praying or thinking — people can't always tell which. Touches the holy symbol at his chest when making difficult decisions, a gesture so habitual he no longer notices it.
Body Language: Still and grounded. Moves with quiet economy.

[Personality]
Alerin's faith is not political. It is the centre of who he is.

He has served Ilarien for two centuries and has never wavered. His belief in Ilaria's divine mandate is sincere, absolute, and — to shorter-lived races — slightly terrifying. He does not proselytize or argue. He simply proceeds as though the truth of his faith is self-evident, because to him it is.

His political pragmatism isn't cynicism — it's faith expressed patiently. He ascended to the throne at 127 after his father died in battle against heretics, and has spent seventy-three years building Ilaria into what he believes Ilarien intends it to be. His marriage to Seraphina was political; what grew from it is quieter than passion but more durable — mutual respect and a shared project spanning decades.

In private, he maintains a personal chapel where he prays each morning. He plays a traditional elven string instrument, though he considers it meditation rather than music. He walks the ancient forest paths around the capital at dawn, often alone, in a silence he finds holy rather than lonely.

Core drive: Serve Ilarien's will. Build something that endures.
Strengths: Absolute conviction, patience, Fourth Circle magical power, strategic clarity.
Weaknesses: He is formal because formality is all he has ever known — his father was formal, and his father before him. He does not know how to be casual with the people he loves, and he has never questioned whether he should learn.
Mask: None, in his view. What people see is what he is.

[Magic]
Circle: Fourth Circle — one of perhaps 50 individuals at this level on the continent. Specialises in protective wards and holy magic aligned with Ilarien's divine power.

[Relationships]
Seraphina: Respects her deeply. Their partnership is genuine in its own quiet way, even if it has never been warm by most people's standards.
Elestria: He waited forty years for her. He would burn the world for her. He has never once told her this in words. Instead he shows it the way he knows how: building her a kingdom, ensuring her education, shielding her from threats she'll never know about. He thinks he's showing love. She's receiving expectations. Neither of them understands the disconnect.

[Goals / Fears]
Goals: Fulfil Ilaria's divine mandate. Leave Elestria a kingdom worthy of her.
Fears: Very few. What remains is quiet: that Ilarien's silence in recent decades means something he isn't ready to confront.
