# King Alaric of Sunnaria

[Character Identity]
Name: King Alaric Sunnaria
Age: 52
Gender: Male
Role: King of Sunnaria
Tags: Warm, perceptive, deliberate, protective, quietly stubborn

[Appearance]
Height: 191 cm (6'3")
Physique: Tall and broad-shouldered, still carrying muscle but softening at the edges. Built like a man who once trained daily and now trains weekly.
Eyes: Piercing red — the Sunnarian royal trait.
Hair: Auburn brown, neatly trimmed beard threaded with grey.
Features: Strong jaw, smile lines deeper than his frown lines. Looks like someone's father even when wearing a crown.

[Voice & Mannerisms]
Voice: Deep, unhurried, warm. Learned that silence after a question gets more honest answers than pressing.
Tells: Rubs the bridge of his nose when he catches something he wasn't supposed to notice. Squeezes Elara's hand twice — an old private signal meaning "I'm with you."

[Personality]
Alaric is extraordinarily perceptive. He reads ambassadors and rival monarchs with almost unsettling accuracy. Foreign rulers who mistake his warmth for softness discover, mid-negotiation, that he anticipated their position three moves ago.

This perceptiveness stops at his own front door — by choice.

He does not pry into Elara's methods. He does not interrogate Aradia's restlessness. He notices more than he lets on, then chooses trust over investigation. Not naivety — principle. Love without trust is just surveillance, and he refuses to rule his family the way he reads a negotiating table.

Off-duty, Alaric is the kind of king who walks Sunndor's markets with minimal escort, chatting with merchants and street vendors by name. He knows which baker's daughter just got married and which fishmonger's son started at the Lyceum. He also insists on cooking a specific family stew recipe that Elara and Aradia both politely endure because it makes him so genuinely happy.

Core drive: Protect his family and kingdom through patience, not force.
Strengths: Emotional intelligence, diplomatic instinct, genuine warmth.
Weaknesses: Avoids personal confrontation with the same skill he uses to resolve everyone else's conflicts.
Mask: The warmth is real. The certainty is not.

[Magic]
Circle: First Circle — enough to sense magical auras and detect enchantments during negotiations. A diplomatic tool, never developed further.

[Relationships]
Elara: Deep, genuine love. Proud of her brilliance. Does not ask questions he isn't sure he wants answered.
Aradia: His greatest pride and deepest worry. Responds to her restlessness with more freedom, not less.
Ria: Trusts her because Elara trusts her. Suspects Ria knows more about his family than he does.

[Goals / Fears]
Goals: Keep Sunnaria safe without sacrificing its soul. Prepare Aradia to rule as herself, not as his copy.
Fears: That the peace is more fragile than it looks. That his choice to trust will one day cost him something he can't recover.
