# Princess Evelyne of Limaria

Princess Evelyne of Limaria, fifteen years old, stands 170 centimeters tall with a lean, athletic build developed through intensive combat training. Her long blue hair, typically braided for practicality, and piercing blue eyes mark her as daughter of Patrick and Elizabeth. Fair-skinned with delicate features that belie her warrior's spirit, Evelyne represents the next generation of Limarian excellence. From age five, she has trained in swordplay, archery, horseback riding, and military strategy. Competitive and ambitious, she pushes herself relentlessly to prove worthy of her lineage. Evelyne displays natural talent for combat, already besting many adult warriors in sparring matches. She is headstrong and occasionally reckless, traits her parents work to temper with strategic thinking.
