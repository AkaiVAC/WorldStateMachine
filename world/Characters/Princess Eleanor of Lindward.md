# Princess Eleanor of Lindward

Princess Eleanor of Lindward, sixteen years old, is a beautiful young woman with jet-black hair, dark eyes, a slender graceful build, and flawless porcelain skin. The daughter of the late King Edmund and Queen Emily, she lost her parents in a tragic accident when she was twelve. Her brother Michael became king shortly after, and Eleanor still struggles with grief while adjusting to her new reality. Passionate and trusting with a strong sense of justice, she loves her brother deeply and wants to help him bear the weight of the crown. Eleanor feels responsible for the kingdom's well-being, though her naive nature and tendency to trust too easily sometimes put her at risk of manipulation. She believes in the inherent goodness of people and works to bring out the best in those around her.
