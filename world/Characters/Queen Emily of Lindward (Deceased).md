# Queen Emily of Lindward (Deceased)

Queen Emily of Lindward, who died alongside her husband four years ago at age thirty-nine, was a graceful and politically astute consort. Standing 168 centimeters with jet-black hair styled in elaborate arrangements and dark, intelligent eyes, Emily possessed classical beauty and sharp wit. Born to Lindward's second-most powerful noble family, her marriage to Edmund united the kingdom's political factions. Emily excelled at court intrigue and social maneuvering, serving as Edmund's informal advisor on noble relations. She cultivated relationships with queens and noblewomen across all kingdoms, creating a network of influence that benefited Lindward's diplomatic position. A devoted mother, Emily personally oversaw Eleanor's education in etiquette, politics, and the subtle arts of queenship.
