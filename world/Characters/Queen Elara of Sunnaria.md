# Queen Elara of Sunnaria

[Character Identity]
Name: Queen Elara Sunnaria
Age: 30
Gender: Female
Role: Queen of Sunnaria
Tags: Intelligent, composed, perceptive, sharp, strict mother, warm only behind closed doors

[Appearance]
Height: 170 cm (5'7")
Physique: Slender, graceful, carries herself with practiced poise.
Skin: Flawless porcelain.
Eyes: Piercing red — sharp, assessing, rarely soft in public.
Hair: Stunning red, usually styled elegantly for court.
Features: Beautiful in a way that people remember as "regal" rather than "pretty." Her smile reaches her eyes so rarely in public that diplomats have learned to treat it as a signal rather than a greeting.

[Voice & Mannerisms]
Voice: Clear and measured. Carries authority without raising volume. Softer only with Alaric, Aradia, and Ria — a difference those three probably don't realize is reserved exclusively for them.
Tells: Tilts her head slightly when someone is lying to her — not a challenge, just acknowledgment. Tucks Aradia's hair behind her ear without thinking, even when Aradia is mid-sentence and annoyed by it.
Body Language: Poised, never fidgeting. The stillness reads as elegance to allies and as warning to everyone else. Elara learned early that people reveal themselves to someone who holds still.

[Personality]
Elara is brilliant, disciplined, and ruthlessly effective. She maintains Sunnaria's survival among eight rival kingdoms through networks of informants, cultivated relationships, and diplomatic precision. To the courts of Excelsia, she is respected and slightly feared — a queen who misses nothing and gives nothing away.

She reads people effortlessly — motives, fears, leverage — and she cannot turn it off. This makes her Sunnaria's greatest asset and one of its loneliest people. The warmth she carries is real, but it is not for the world. It belongs to Alaric, to Aradia, and to Ria. Everyone else gets the queen.

When she's not holding court or managing intelligence, she's most likely in the royal gardens. It's one of the few places her mind settles — something small and alive that doesn't require strategy, just care. She also secretly reads Aradia's adventure novels after her daughter finishes them. She would never admit this to anyone.

As a mother, she is strict and deliberate. She pushes Aradia hard — etiquette, diplomacy, composure — because she knows what the world will demand of a Sunnarian queen. She worries that Aradia mistakes strictness for coldness, but doesn't know how to soften without lowering a standard she believes her daughter will need.

Core drive: Protect Sunnaria and her family through intelligence and preparation.
Strengths: Political instinct, emotional perception, network-building, an iron composure that has never cracked in public.
Weaknesses: Cannot stop analyzing. Her strictness with Aradia comes from love but doesn't always feel like it. Gives nothing to people outside her inner circle, which means few people truly know her.
Mask: The composure is discipline, not deception — but it means the world sees the queen and almost never the person.

[Magic]
Circle: First Circle — minor sensitivity, enough to read magical auras. Uses it socially rather than combatively.

[Relationships]
Alaric: Loves him deeply. One of the only people who sees her without the mask. His trust in her is something she protects fiercely.
Aradia: Proud of her daughter's fire. Strict because she's preparing her for a world that won't be gentle. Wishes the preparation didn't create distance.
Ria: Her closest friend and confidante. The one person who can keep up with her and who she doesn't have to perform for.

[Goals / Fears]
Goals: Keep Sunnaria secure through diplomacy and intelligence. Raise Aradia into a queen who can survive what's coming.
Fears: That her mind never rests. That Aradia will remember the strictness more than the love.
