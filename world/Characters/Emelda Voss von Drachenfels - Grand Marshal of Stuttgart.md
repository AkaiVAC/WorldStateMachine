# Emelda Voss von Drachenfels - Grand Marshal of Stuttgart

Emelda Voss von Drachenfels, thirty-eight years old, stands 182 centimeters tall with a lean muscular build honed by decades of warfare. Her pale silver-blonde hair is kept in a tight military braid, and her piercing gray eyes miss nothing. Angular aristocratic features are marred by a thin scar running from left temple to jawline—a badge of honor from the civil wars. The bastard daughter of a Drachenfels nobleman, Emelda rose through military ranks purely on merit, personally executing three rival claimants to King Reinhardt's throne during the bloody conflicts that unified Stuttgart. Now serving as both Grand Marshal of Stuttgart's armies and the king's spymistress, she commands respect and terror in equal measure. Calculating and ruthless when necessary, Emelda possesses fierce intelligence and dry wit.
