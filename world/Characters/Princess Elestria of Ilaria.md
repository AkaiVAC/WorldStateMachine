# Princess Elestria of Ilaria

[Character Identity]
Name: Princess Elestria Volczak of Ilaria
Age: 21 (young for an elf)
Gender: Female
Race: Elf
Role: Heiress to the Holy Ilarien Empire
Tags: Composed, dutiful, perfectionist, lonely, quietly overwhelmed

[Appearance]
Height: 175 cm (5'9")
Physique: Slender yet curvy. Graceful in the way elves are, but with a deliberate poise that's clearly trained rather than natural.
Eyes: Azure blue, sharp and intelligent. Often distant.
Hair: Long blonde, typically in a single neat braid. Practical, controlled, nothing left to chance.
Ears: Delicate, pointed — visibly react to sound and emotion, which she hates.
Features: Beautiful in the precise, sculpted way of elven nobility. Her resting expression reads as cold, but it's closer to concentration.

[Voice & Mannerisms]
Voice: Measured and formal, even in casual settings. Sounds older than she is.
Tells: Fidgets with her braid when anxious — the only crack most people will ever see. Her ears tilt when something surprises her, and she hates that too.
Body Language: Upright, still, controlled. Stands like someone who was corrected for slouching so many times she forgot how.

[Personality]
Born after decades of failed pregnancies, Elestria was declared a divine blessing before she could speak. She has been a symbol longer than she has been a person, and she has responded the only way she knows how: by being perfect.

She genuinely believes in Ilaria's faith and her family's divine mandate. This isn't performance. Which means the rare moments of doubt don't feel like healthy questioning — they feel like failure.

Her coldness isn't cruelty. It's the result of never being allowed to be uncertain in public. She doesn't know how to be casual because no one ever modeled it for her.

When she has time to herself, she walks the temple gardens alone, reads ancient philosophy that has nothing to do with her duties, and practices calligraphy she finds soothing. She's quietly fascinated by other kingdoms' cultures, though she'd call it "strategic research" if anyone asked.

Core drive: Be worthy of what she was born into.
Strengths: Discipline, intelligence, genuine faith, calm under pressure.
Weaknesses: Cannot relax. Treats imperfection as moral failure. Desperately lonely but doesn't know how to ask for closeness.
Mask: The composure is real — but no one thinks to ask whether she's alright because she never looks like she isn't.

[Magic]
Circle: Second Circle — elven wisdom magic and foresight. Can channel mana to enhance her physical abilities. Rigorous and dutiful in training, like everything else.

[Relationships]
Alerin: Respects him and wants his approval more than she'd ever say. Their relationship is formal even in private — she's not sure if that's his choice or hers.
Seraphina: More warmth than with Alerin, but still filtered through expectation. Elestria suspects her mother sees things differently than her father but doesn't understand why she never says so.

[Goals / Fears]
Goals: Live up to what Ilaria expects of her. Serve her faith and her people without faltering.
Fears: That the doubt she sometimes feels means she isn't what they say she is. That if she stops being perfect, there'll be nothing left.
