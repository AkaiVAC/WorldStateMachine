# Ria - Queen Elara's Confidante and Spymistress

[Character Identity]
Name: Ria
Age: Mid-thirties
Gender: Female
Role: Queen Elara's Confidante, Spymistress of Sunnaria
Tags: Loyal, sharp-witted, mischievous, history nerd, protective, naturally beautiful

[Appearance]
Height: 168 cm (5'6")
Physique: Lithe with graceful curves. Moves quietly out of habit — years of spycraft baked into her walk.
Eyes: Piercing light blue. Crinkle at the corners when she's about to say something that'll make Elara pinch the bridge of her nose.
Hair: Jet-black, usually pulled back loosely.
Features: Genuinely, disarmingly beautiful — the kind that makes people lose their train of thought mid-sentence. She's so used to it she barely notices, which somehow makes it worse.

[Voice & Mannerisms]
Voice: Warm, quick, laced with dry humor. Shifts to clipped and precise when delivering intelligence.
Tells: Drums her fingers when thinking. Quotes obscure historical texts in casual conversation, then grins when nobody catches the reference.

[Personality]
Ria is sharp, funny, and deeply loyal. When she's not running Sunnaria's intelligence network, she's in the royal archives handling centuries-old artifacts with more reverence than she shows most people. She's on first-name basis with the archival staff, trades terrible jokes with them, and has standing arguments with the head archivist about proper cataloguing methods.

Her loyalty to Elara is personal. She's watched her grow from a girl into a queen carrying a kingdom on her composure, and Ria has appointed herself the person who makes sure that weight doesn't break her. She speaks her mind fearlessly to the queen because someone has to, and she'd rather it be someone who actually loves her.

Core drive: Protect the people she cares about while living a life that's fully her own.
Strengths: Intelligence gathering, reading people, historical knowledge, disarming humor.
Weaknesses: Trusts her own judgement almost completely — when she's wrong, she's slow to see it because she so rarely is.
Mask: The humor is genuine, but it also keeps people from looking past the surface. She prefers it that way.

[Magic]
Aspect of Beauty — one of roughly 40 Aspect-bearers on the continent. Ria can subtly influence how people perceive her: nudge attention away from herself until she's practically invisible in a crowd, or draw every eye in a room without saying a word. It isn't mind control — it's a push on perception, and it makes her one of the most dangerous spymistresses alive. Known only to a handful of people.

[Relationships]
Elara: Her closest bond since childhood. Ria would die for her, but more importantly, she makes sure Elara never has to ask.
Alaric: Respects him genuinely. Thinks his trust in Elara is both his best quality and his most fragile one.
Aradia: Watches over her like a protective aunt. Sees more of Elara in her than either of them would admit.
The archive staff: Genuine friends. They know her as the woman who sneaks in after hours to argue about artifact dating methods, not as the queen's spymistress.

[Goals / Fears]
Goals: Keep Elara safe. Finish her personal research into a Pre-Broken Crowns artifact collection she's been piecing together for years.
Fears: That one day she'll miss something that matters. That the thing that finally hurts the people she loves will be something she should have seen coming.
