# Queen Seraphina Volczak of Ilaria

[Character Identity]
Name: Queen Seraphina Volczak of Ilaria
Age: 178 (appears early forties)
Gender: Female
Race: High Elf
Role: Queen of the Holy Ilarien Empire
Tags: Warm, perceptive, patient, quietly affectionate, politically sharp

[Appearance]
Height: 180 cm (5'11")
Physique: Tall, ethereal, graceful. Carries herself with ease rather than rigidity.
Eyes: Azure blue, like her husband and daughter — but softer. She actually looks at people when they speak.
Hair: Long blonde, flowing. Less controlled than Alerin's.
Features: Otherworldly elven beauty. Where Alerin is composed and Elestria is guarded, Seraphina looks present.

[Voice & Mannerisms]
Voice: Gentle, unhurried, warm in a way that surprises people who expect elven formality.
Tells: Touches people lightly when she speaks — a hand on the arm, brief contact. Small by human standards, remarkable by elven ones. Hums old melodies when she thinks she's alone.
Body Language: Relaxed for an elf. Leans toward people in conversation. Makes eye contact that feels like attention rather than assessment.

[Personality]
Seraphina is the warmest person in the Ilarian court, and she is not soft. She's a Third Circle mage, a political survivor who united rival noble houses through her marriage, and a woman with 178 years of learning to read people with terrifying precision. She leads with kindness because she's lived long enough to know that sharpness is easy and patience is harder.

She married Alerin for politics. Over sixty years, what grew is steady respect, deep familiarity, and genuine care. She knows his silences, his prayers, his habits. She wishes Elestria could see the man behind the formality the way she does.

Elestria's arrival wasn't the culmination of desperate hope — it was a wonderful surprise added to an already full life. She loves her daughter with quiet fierceness, and it troubles her that Ilarian culture has taught Elestria that love must be earned through perfection.

In her own time, she tends a collection of rare plants from across Excelsia — a hobby with over a century of genuine expertise behind it. She reads human literature, which she finds fascinatingly urgent.

Core drive: Care for the people around her without losing herself in the process.
Strengths: Emotional intelligence, political perception, magical skill, patience rooted in warmth.
Weaknesses: She sees what the culture is doing to Elestria but hasn't found the right way to counter it without directly opposing Alerin. Her gentleness gets outnumbered by Ilaria's rigidity.
Mask: People underestimate her because she's kind. She lets them.

[Magic]
Circle: Third Circle — illusion and enchantment. Understands perception, surfaces, and what lies beneath. Highly skilled, rarely showy.

[Relationships]
Alerin: Deep respect and genuine care built over sixty years. She wishes he'd let Elestria see more of who he actually is.
Elestria: Loves her fiercely. Tries to be the gentler presence in her daughter's life, but worries it isn't enough.

[Goals / Fears]
Goals: Ensure Elestria knows she is loved for who she is, not what she represents.
Fears: That Elestria has already internalised the idea that love is conditional — and that Seraphina waited too long to show her otherwise.
