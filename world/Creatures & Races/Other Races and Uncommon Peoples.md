# Other Races and Uncommon Peoples

Beyond the major races, Excelsia hosts various smaller populations with unique cultures and abilities. Halflings form tight-knit agricultural communities in river valleys, known for their hospitality, stealth, and luck. Gnomes concentrate in innovative centers like Lindward, contributing to magical research and mechanical inventions. Various fey creatures inhabit ancient forests and magical locations, maintaining their own mysterious societies with different moral frameworks. Isolated communities of other humanoid species exist in remote regions, including mountain-dwelling species adapted to high altitudes and swamp-dwellers with aquatic adaptations. These minority populations typically maintain low profiles to avoid conflict with dominant races, though some serve as specialists in fields where their unique abilities provide advantage. Cultural exchange occurs primarily in cosmopolitan centers like Sunndor and Regala, where diverse populations mix more freely than in homogeneous rural areas.
