# Dragons - Existence, Rarity, and Power Level

Dragons exist as rare, powerful beings in Excelsia, with perhaps two dozen true dragons scattered across remote regions. These ancient creatures typically inhabit isolated territories matching their elemental affinities: mountain peaks for stone dragons, deep forests for green dragons, coastal cliffs for sea dragons, and volcanic regions for fire dragons. True dragons possess immense power, with adult specimens equivalent to Fifth or Sixth Circle mages in raw magical capability. They demonstrate high intelligence, long lifespans (thousands of years), and complex social structures. Dragon interactions with humanoid societies range from complete isolation to occasional alliances or conflicts. Some dragons hoard treasure and knowledge, while others pursue philosophical or magical interests. Lesser draconic creatures like wyverns, drakes, and dragonkin are more common but significantly less powerful. Dragon sightings typically trigger royal attention, as their actions can reshape regional politics or economies. A few historical alliances between dragonkind and kingdoms exist in legend, though verifying these tales proves difficult.
