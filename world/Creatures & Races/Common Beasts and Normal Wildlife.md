# Common Beasts and Normal Wildlife

Excelsia hosts diverse wildlife adapted to its varied climates and terrains. Northern regions like Stuttgart support cold-adapted species including snow wolves, frost bears, and mountain goats. Central plains and forests host deer, boars, wolves, and bears typical of temperate climates. Southern jungles and savannas feature tropical species like jungle cats, giant constrictors, and exotic birds. Domesticated animals include horses (varying by region from sturdy northern breeds to swift southern racers), cattle, sheep, poultry, and working animals like oxen and dogs. Wildlife populations face pressure from expanding settlements and resource extraction, particularly near kingdom borders and trade routes. Hunting regulations vary by kingdom, with some like Aeldrin implementing strict conservation measures while others prioritize resource extraction. Magical enhancement of animals occurs occasionally, either through natural mutation, deliberate breeding, or accidental exposure to magical energies.
