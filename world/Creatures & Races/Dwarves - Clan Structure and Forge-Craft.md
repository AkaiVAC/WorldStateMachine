# Dwarves - Clan Structure and Forge-Craft

Dwarves constitute approximately 5% of Excelsia's population (~2 million total), with approximately 1.5 million concentrated in Ironforge's mountain halls (making dwarves 90% of that kingdom's population) and another 500,000 distributed across other kingdoms. Notable dwarven quarters exist in Sunndor (~150K), Regala (~120K), Silvercrest (~100K), and smaller communities in all coastal and mountain cities. Notable dwarven quarters exist in Sunndor, Regala, and Silvercrest. Dwarven society revolves around clan structures, with each clan specializing in specific crafts like metalworking, stonecutting, or gem cutting. Their lifespan averages 300-400 years, allowing mastery of complex crafts across generations. Dwarven culture values honor, tradition, craftsmanship, and clan loyalty above individual achievement. Their underground cities represent marvels of engineering, with precisely carved stone, sophisticated ventilation, and defensive systems that have withstood centuries of siege. Dwarven forge-craft produces the continent's finest weapons, armor, and metalwork, sought after by nobles and warriors across Excelsia. Dwarves possess innate talent for earth magic and protective enchantments, making their mountain homes nearly impregnable. While sometimes perceived as stubborn or isolationist, dwarves maintain strong trade relationships and honor their commitments with absolute reliability. The ancient pact between Ironforge and Aeldrin demonstrates dwarves' capacity for enduring cross-species alliances.
