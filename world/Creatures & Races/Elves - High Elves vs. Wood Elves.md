# Elves - High Elves vs. Wood Elves

Elves represent approximately 15% of Excelsia's population, divided between high elves and wood elves with distinct cultures and lifespans averaging 600-800 years. High elves dominate Ilaria and urban centers, valuing magical mastery, artistic perfection, and sophisticated civilization. Their long perspective makes them patient strategists but sometimes arrogant toward shorter-lived races. Wood elves primarily inhabit Aeldrin's forests, emphasizing nature connection, spiritual traditions, and harmonious living with their environment. Both elf types possess inherent magical affinity, particularly for nature, illusion, and enchantment magic. Elven reproduction rates remain low, making each life precious and explaining their cautious approach to conflict. Elven culture emphasizes family lineages, ancestral traditions, and gradual cultural evolution. Tensions exist between traditionalist elves who prefer isolation and progressive factions advocating greater engagement with human kingdoms. Elven architecture blends seamlessly with natural surroundings, and their craftsmanship produces items of legendary quality and durability.
