# Beast-Folk Taxonomy and Cultural Diversity

Beast-folk represent approximately 7.5% of Excelsia's population, with Zyronia hosting the majority (60% of kingdom population). Major categories include feline tribes (agile hunters with enhanced senses), canine packs (loyal trackers with pack mentality), ursine clans (powerful warriors with seasonal rhythms), avian flocks (aerial scouts with nesting territories), reptilian scales (desert-adapted with temperature regulation), and aquatic schools (river and coastal dwellers with swimming adaptations). Each type possesses physical adaptations and cultural traditions reflecting their animal heritage. Beast-folk societies typically organize tribally rather than feudally, with leadership based on strength, wisdom, or spiritual connection. They maintain deep connections to natural cycles and often serve as guardians of wilderness areas. Beast-folk magic emphasizes primal forces, transformation, and enhancement of natural abilities. While sometimes facing prejudice from other races, beast-folk communities have proven resilient and maintain their cultural identity despite pressure from expanding human and elven civilizations. Beyond Zyronia, significant beast-folk populations include Sunnaria (8% - diverse urban communities), Aeldrin (5% - forest-adapted tribes living alongside elves), and scattered minorities in port cities across all coastal kingdoms. Beast-folk in human-majority kingdoms often face social prejudice but fill essential roles as scouts, trackers, sailors, and laborers in jobs requiring their specialized physical capabilities. Zyronia's total population of approximately 2.5 million includes 1.5 million beast-folk (60% of kingdom) and 1 million humans and other races. The remaining 1.5 million beast-folk (3M total - 1.5M in Zyronia) distribute across other kingdoms: Sunnaria (~520K, 8%), Aeldrin (~175K, 15%), and scattered coastal/port communities (~805K) in Lunaria, Lindward, Limaria, and Stuttgart.
