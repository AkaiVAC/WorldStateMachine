# Undead - Existence, Prevalence, and Causes

Undead creatures result from necromantic magic, spiritual unrest, or natural magical phenomena in places of death or strong emotion. Animated skeletons and zombies represent the most common forms, typically created through necromantic spells or arising spontaneously in magically active burial sites. More powerful undead like wraiths, specters, and liches require significant magical power or extraordinary circumstances to manifest. Undead prevalence varies regionally, with ancient battlefields, plague burial grounds, and places of tragic history more likely to spawn restless dead. Most kingdoms strictly regulate or prohibit necromancy, though some academic institutions study it for theoretical understanding. Temples often maintain consecrated grounds and rituals to prevent undead manifestation. Remote or poorly maintained cemeteries sometimes experience problems with spontaneous undead activity, requiring periodic cleansing by temple guards or adventurers. Cultural attitudes toward death and proper burial practices significantly influence undead occurrence rates across different kingdoms.
