# Demons and Fey - Role in World and Accessibility

Extraplanar beings including demons and fey occasionally interact with Excelsia, though most encounters remain rare and localized. Demonic entities typically emerge from planar rifts, failed summoning rituals, or places tainted by dark magic. They range from minor imps causing mischief to powerful demons seeking to corrupt or destroy. Fey creatures inhabit ancient forests, magical springs, and places where the barrier between worlds grows thin. They follow alien moral codes and often deal in bargains, tricks, and poetic justice. Both demonic and fey interactions require specific circumstances: demons typically need invitation, summoning, or dimensional weakness, while fey respond to proper rituals, offerings, or moments of transition like dawn or solstice. Most kingdoms maintain protocols for dealing with extraplanar incursions, from temple exorcisms to specialized magical containment. Knowledgeable mages can sometimes negotiate with these beings for power or information, though such bargains carry significant risks.
