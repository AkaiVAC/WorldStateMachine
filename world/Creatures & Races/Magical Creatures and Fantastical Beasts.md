# Magical Creatures and Fantastical Beasts

Various magical creatures inhabit Excelsia's wilderness, often in remote or magically-rich regions. Griffons nest in high mountain peaks, sometimes domesticated as elite aerial mounts by wealthy nobles or military units. Basilisks dwell in deep caves and ancient ruins, their petrifying gaze making them both feared and sought after for alchemical ingredients. Dragons exist as rare, powerful beings typically inhabiting isolated territories, with different types adapted to various environments (mountain, forest, coastal). Other magical creatures include hippogriffs, wyverns, cockatrices, and various elemental beings tied to specific natural features. These creatures often possess innate magical abilities and sometimes demonstrate intelligence rivaling or exceeding human levels. Interactions range from peaceful coexistence to dangerous predation, with some kingdoms maintaining specialized monster-hunting units to protect settlements. Magical creature parts hold value for enchantment, alchemy, and ritual magic, creating economic incentives for hunting that sometimes threatens rare species.
