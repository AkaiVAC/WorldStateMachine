# Humans - Cultural Variations and Society

Humans constitute approximately 70% of Excelsia's 40 million population (~28 million total). The human population is distributed: Sunnaria (~7M), Ilaria (~4.5M, 45% of kingdom), Limaria (~4M), Lindward (~3.5M), Stuttgart (~3M), Lunaria (~2.5M), with smaller populations in Aeldrin (~1.5M, 15%), Ironforge (~1M, 10%), and Zyronia (~1.5M, 25%). This distribution reflects each kingdom's size, climate, and historical settlement patterns. Sunnarian humans value diplomacy, commerce, and adaptability, their central position fostering cosmopolitan attitudes. Limarians embrace martial pride, discipline, and honor above all else. Stuttgart humans exhibit northern resilience, practicality, and meritocratic values. Lindward humans prioritize wealth, refinement, and social status. Lumians combine religious devotion with economic pragmatism. Human communities in Ilaria face tension between adopting elven customs and preserving their heritage. Human minorities in Aeldrin, Ironforge, and Zyronia often serve as cultural bridges between species. Human society typically follows feudal structures with nobility, clergy, merchants, and peasants, though the balance of power varies by kingdom. Human adaptability allows rapid cultural evolution and technological adoption, though this sometimes creates conflict with longer-lived, tradition-bound races like elves and dwarves. Human communities exist as minorities in Aeldrin (15% - loggers, traders, craftsmen), Ironforge (10% - merchants, diplomats, surface farmers), and Zyronia (25% - coastal traders, missionaries, agricultural specialists). These communities serve as cultural intermediaries but sometimes face tension between maintaining their heritage and integrating into dominant local cultures.
