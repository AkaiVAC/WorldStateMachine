# Religious Festivals Per Deity

Each of the Seven Divine has associated festivals celebrated across Excelsia, though timing and traditions vary by kingdom. Solarius's Sun-Return Festival at spring equinox features bonfires, renewal vows, and solar magic displays. Lunara's Moon-Festival during summer solstice involves night vigils, divination, and lunar magic ceremonies. Ilarien's Wisdom-Conclave in autumn gathers scholars for debates, knowledge sharing, and prophecy readings. Valorax's Honor-Games in late summer feature martial competitions, weapon blessings, and strategic demonstrations. Mercuros's Trade-Fair at harvest time combines commerce with religious ceremony, blessing caravans and trade agreements. Silvanna's Bloom-Festival in spring celebrates nature's renewal with planting rituals, forest blessings, and animal husbandry ceremonies. Forgefather's Craft-Gathering in winter showcases artisans' work, with masterpieces dedicated to temples and new apprentices sworn in. These festivals serve multiple purposes: religious devotion, community cohesion, economic activity, and political display. Royal participation demonstrates piety and connects rulers to divine favor, while common folk enjoy rare leisure and celebration.
