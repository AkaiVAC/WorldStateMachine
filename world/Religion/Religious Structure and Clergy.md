# Religious Structure and Clergy

Religious worship in Excelsia is decentralized with no central religious authority. Coordination between temples occurs through the Septennial Conclave—a gathering of high priests from each deity's worship every seven years in rotating host kingdoms. This conclave resolves doctrinal disputes, coordinates inter-faith relations, and addresses challenges facing religious communities, but has no enforcement power beyond moral authority and social pressure. Each kingdom maintains temples to all Seven Divine but favors certain deities according to their culture. Clergy serve as advisors, healers, educators, and community leaders rather than rulers. Temple hierarchies vary by deity and kingdom, but typically include high priests, acolytes, and specialized roles like healers, scholars, or warriors. Religious practices include daily prayers, seasonal festivals, life cycle ceremonies, and deity-specific rituals. Temples often serve multiple functions beyond worship, including education, healing, dispute resolution, and community gathering.
