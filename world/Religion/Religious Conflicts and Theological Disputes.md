# Religious Conflicts and Theological Disputes

Despite the shared pantheon, religious conflicts occasionally arise from theological differences, competing claims of divine favor, or clashes between religious and secular authority. The primary tension exists between Solarius's lawful order and Lunara's mysterious freedom, playing out in debates over magic regulation and social organization. Ilaria's claim of exclusive Ilarien favor conflicts with other kingdoms' assertions of equal divine attention. Disputes over interpretation of prophecies sometimes lead different temples to support conflicting political factions. Religious schisms occur when reform movements challenge traditional hierarchies or interpretations. Secular rulers sometimes clash with temple authorities over jurisdiction, particularly regarding magical crimes, moral legislation, or resource allocation. Most conflicts remain theological or political rather than violent, though historical religious wars inform current cautious approaches to inter-faith relations. The decentralized nature of Excelsian religion prevents continent-wide conflicts but allows localized tensions to develop. Resolution typically involves theological debate, royal mediation, or practical compromise respecting different interpretations while maintaining social harmony.
