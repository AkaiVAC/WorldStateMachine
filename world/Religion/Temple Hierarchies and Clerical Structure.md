# Temple Hierarchies and Clerical Structure

Each deity's worship follows organized temple hierarchies while maintaining decentralized authority across kingdoms. Solarius's temples employ Sun-Priests (local clergy), Light-Bringers (regional administrators), and Dawn-Speakers (kingdom-level authorities). Lunara's mystery cults use more fluid structures with Moon-Acolytes, Shadow-Weavers, and Dream-Interpreters based on magical attainment rather than administrative rank. Ilarien's temples organize around knowledge specialization with Lore-Keepers, Wisdom-Scribes, and Truth-Seekers managing different domains of learning. Valorax's warrior-priests follow military ranks from Blade-Acolyte to War-Priest to Battle-Commander. Mercuros's traveling clergy include Road-Wardens, Trade-Masters, and Message-Bearers facilitating communication. Silvanna's nature priests organize by ecosystem with Grove-Tenders, River-Watchers, and Mountain-Guardians. Forgefather's dwarven clergy use craft-guild ranks from Apprentice-Smith to Master-Artificer to Clan-Forgepriest. While temple authorities hold spiritual influence, they typically avoid direct political rule, serving as advisors to secular powers. Tensions sometimes arise between temple hierarchies and royal authority, particularly regarding magical regulation, moral oversight, or resource allocation for religious projects.
