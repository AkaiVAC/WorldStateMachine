# Aradia Sneaks Out of the Palace

The last almond cake had been four hours ago.

Aradia lay on her back in the dark of her chambers, the silk sheets kicked into a knot at the foot of the bed, and stared at the ceiling. The sandstone still radiated the day's heat. Somewhere beyond her window, the Golden Delta lapped quietly against the harbor walls, and the palace was doing that thing it did after midnight — settling into a silence so complete that her own breathing sounded like an intrusion.

She wasn't hungry. Not really. She'd had a full dinner, and the cake after, and the second cake she'd taken when the cook's back was turned. She was fine.

She thought about the kitchen. The big one, two floors down, where the night staff left the pastry trays covered with linen cloths that were laughably easy to lift. There would be something under those cloths. There was always something.

She was fine. She was a princess. She had responsibilities in the morning — a trade ledger review her mother had assigned with the particular tone that meant *this is not optional, Aradia* — and sneaking through her own palace at midnight for leftover pastries was exactly the kind of thing that shouldn't require courage. And yet her heart was already beating faster, which was embarrassing, which made her angry, which made her want to do it more.

Aradia sat up, swung her legs off the bed, and reached for her slippers.
