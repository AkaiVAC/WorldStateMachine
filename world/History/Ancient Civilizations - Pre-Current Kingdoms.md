# Ancient Civilizations - Pre-Current Kingdoms

Before the current eight kingdoms, Excelsia hosted several advanced civilizations whose ruins dot the landscape. The Sunken Empire of Meridia once dominated the southern coasts, leaving behind submerged cities and mysterious artifacts. The Crystal Peaks civilization of mountain-dwellers created intricate underground networks now occupied by dwarves. The Whispering Woods culture of ancient fey and elves left magical groves and standing stones throughout Aeldrin's forests. These civilizations collapsed for various reasons: Meridia to rising sea levels and internal conflict, Crystal Peaks to resource exhaustion, Whispering Woods to gradual integration with newer settlements. These civilizations existed approximately 2,000-4,000 years ago, predating current kingdoms by millennia. Current scholarly consensus suggests modern races are descended from survivors of these collapsed societies, though elven oral traditions claim continuity stretching back 10,000 years. Politically, kingdoms claim sovereignty over ruins within their borders, though enforcement in remote areas proves difficult, creating grey areas where adventurers and archaeologists operate semi-legally. Their ruins contain advanced magical knowledge, architectural techniques, and sometimes dangerous remnants. Archaeological expeditions frequently seek these sites for historical understanding and potential technological or magical advantages. However, ancient protections, curses, or still-functional magical systems make exploration hazardous. Some scholars believe current magical traditions descend from these lost civilizations, though direct connections remain speculative.
