# Languages and Writing Systems

Excelsia hosts diverse languages reflecting its racial and cultural variety. Common Tongue serves as the trade language understood by educated individuals across kingdoms, derived from ancient human dialects with elven and dwarven loanwords. Racial languages include Elvish (with high and wood elf variations), Dwarvish (noted for precise technical vocabulary), and various Beast-tongues (often incorporating non-verbal elements). Kingdom-specific dialects of Common Tongue carry distinct accents and vocabularies reflecting local culture and history. Writing systems include the Common Script used for official documents and education, Elvish Runes for magical inscriptions, Dwarvish Glyphs for stone carving, and various pictorial systems used by beast-folk tribes. Literacy rates vary significantly by social class and kingdom, from near-universal among Lindward's merchant class to limited among Zyronia's tribal communities. Multilingualism proves common in border regions and among traders, diplomats, and scholars. Language barriers sometimes create diplomatic challenges or commercial advantages for those possessing rare linguistic skills.
