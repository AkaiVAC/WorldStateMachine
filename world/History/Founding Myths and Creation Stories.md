# Founding Myths and Creation Stories

Each kingdom maintains distinct founding myths explaining their origins and relationship to the divine. The Seven Divine feature prominently in most creation narratives, though their roles and relationships vary by cultural interpretation. Sunnaria's myth emphasizes Solarius blessing the river deltas and teaching humans diplomacy and trade. Lunaria's foundation story centers on Lunara gifting moon magic to the first queen and establishing matriarchal rule. Ilaria claims direct descent from Ilarien's chosen elves, with the god personally guiding their settlement and granting magical knowledge. Limaria's warriors trace their lineage to Valorax's first champions who tamed the wild lands through strength and honor. These myths serve political purposes, legitimizing current power structures and cultural values. While details differ, common themes include divine guidance, heroic founders overcoming great challenges, and sacred covenants between people and deities. Modern scholars debate the historical accuracy of these stories, though they remain central to cultural identity and royal legitimacy across Excelsia.
