# Calendar and Timekeeping Systems

Excelsia uses a standardized calendar based on solar cycles with 365 days divided into 12 months of 30 days each, plus five festival days between years. The year begins with Spring Equinox, marking renewal and the start of the agricultural cycle. Months bear names reflecting seasonal changes and divine associations: Sun's Return (spring), Bloom-Tide, Planter's Moon, High Sun (summer), Harvest-Tide, Reaper's Moon, Leaf-Fall (autumn), Frost-Tide, Hunter's Moon, Deep Cold (winter), Ice-Tide, and Wolf's Moon. Each kingdom maintains its own year-counting system based on significant local events, creating confusion in historical records. The current most widely used system dates from the War of Broken Crowns 150 years ago. Timekeeping relies on sundials, water clocks, and magical timepieces in wealthy households. Seasonal festivals align with agricultural cycles and divine holy days, creating a rhythm of life shared across kingdoms despite cultural differences. Astronomical observations play important roles in both practical matters like navigation and spiritual practices tied to celestial events.
