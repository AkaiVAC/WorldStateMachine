# The War of Broken Crowns - Historical Foundation

The War of Broken Crowns occurred 150 years ago, a devastating conflict that reshaped Excelsia's political landscape. Triggered by succession disputes in three neighboring kingdoms, the war escalated into a continent-wide struggle that lasted twelve years and claimed approximately 2.8 million lives (7% of the population at that time), devastating entire regions through direct combat, famine, disease, and displaced populations. The psychological and economic trauma took generations to heal. The conflict earned its name from the seven royal crowns shattered during the fighting, including the complete extinction of two royal bloodlines. The war concluded with the formation of the Three Great Kingdoms Alliance between Sunnaria, Lunaria, and Ilaria, establishing a triangular mutual defense pact with rotating leadership. This alliance created continental stability but also institutionalized the dominance of the three largest kingdoms over their smaller neighbors. The war's legacy includes deep-seated animosities between certain noble houses, disputed border territories, and the military traditions that define kingdoms like Limaria and Stuttgart today.
