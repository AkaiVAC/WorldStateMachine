# The Three Great Kingdoms Alliance

The Three Great Kingdoms—Sunnaria, Lunaria, and Ilaria—formed a mutual defense alliance 150 years ago following the War of Broken Crowns. Rotating leadership grants the designated kingdom specific powers: hosting the Alliance Council at their capital, commanding joint military operations if war is declared, serving as final arbiter in internal disputes between member kingdoms, and holding veto power over new alliance initiatives. Leadership rotates in fixed order (Sunnaria → Lunaria → Ilaria) every decade, ensuring each kingdom holds power for 10 years of every 30-year cycle. Leadership rotates in fixed order every decade, though the transition often involves intense negotiation over specific powers. The system has survived 150 years through careful compromise rather than perfect harmony, with Sunnaria frequently mediating disputes between Lunaria and Ilaria during leadership transitions. The alliance maintains continental stability through coordinated diplomacy, shared military resources, and economic cooperation. Each kingdom brings unique strengths: Sunnaria's central trade position, Lunaria's naval power, and Ilaria's magical superiority. The alliance has prevented major continental wars for a century and a half. The alliance focuses on preventing major continent-wide wars rather than policing every border skirmish. Minor conflicts like the Limaria-Stuttgart territorial disputes are tolerated as pressure-release valves, provided they don't escalate to threaten continental stability or draw in other kingdoms.
