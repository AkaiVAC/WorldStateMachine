# Kingdom of Ironforge - The Dwarven Halls

Ironforge is the dwarven kingdom in the southwest Thunderpeak Mountains, an alpine realm of sprawling subterranean halls and surface fortresses. The dwarves control critical mountain passes that serve as essential trade routes between eastern and western Excelsia, making them indispensable neutral traders. Ironforge's exports of precious metals, gemstones, and masterfully forged weapons and armor are coveted throughout the continent. The kingdom maintains an ancient pact with Aeldrin, creating a durable elven-dwarven alliance. Dwarven culture emphasizes clan loyalty, craftsmanship, and traditional values, with governance through a council of clan elders. Despite their neutrality, Ironforge's strategic position and military strength make them influential in continental politics, often serving as honest brokers in disputes between human kingdoms. Multiple kingdoms have attempted to find alternative routes through the Thunderpeaks, but combination of treacherous terrain, harsh weather, and dwarven patrols make unauthorized passes prohibitively dangerous. Sea routes around the mountain range add weeks to journey times and face Lunarian naval tolls, making Ironforge's controlled passes the practical choice despite premium pricing. This monopoly represents Ironforge's primary diplomatic leverage.
