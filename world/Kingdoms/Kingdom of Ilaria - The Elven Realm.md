# Kingdom of Ilaria - The Elven Realm

Ilaria is the largest kingdom in Excelsia, occupying the southeastern territories with a subtropical climate. As an elven-majority kingdom (60% elves), Ilaria maintains ancient traditions and a culturally expansionist attitude. This expansionism creates tension within the Three Great Kingdoms Alliance, with Sunnaria frequently mediating between Ilarian ambitions and Zyronian resistance. Lunaria tacitly supports Ilaria's cultural influence while publicly maintaining neutrality, viewing elven civilization as preferable to beast-folk tribal structures. King Alerin Volczak, a 200+ year old elf and Circle 4 mage, rules alongside Queen Seraphina Volczak. The kingdom houses the oldest and most prestigious magic academy and possesses advanced magical artifacts. Ilaria's economy combines magical research, luxury crafts, and agricultural production from its fertile lands.
