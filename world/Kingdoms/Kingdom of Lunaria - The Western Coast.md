# Kingdom of Lunaria - The Western Coast

Lunaria dominates Excelsia's western coastline with a temperate oceanic climate characterized by mild temperatures and abundant rainfall. As a maritime trade power, Lunaria maintains the continent's largest navy and controls major shipping lanes. Major port cities including Silverhaven, Tidecrest, and Moonport support the kingdom's naval operations, with extensive shipyards, naval academies, and merchant quarters serving both military and commercial functions. The capital Nocturnia sits on a natural deep-water harbor. The kingdom's economy relies on fishing, shipbuilding, and overseas trade. King Cedric and Queen Emelda rule from the capital Nocturnia, known for its moonstone architecture and advanced magical infrastructure including moonstone-powered streetlamps, enchanted water purification systems, message-crystal networks for rapid communication, and magical climate control in major buildings—maintaining medieval aesthetics while providing conveniences through arcane means rather than mechanical technology.
