# Kingdom of Limaria - The Iron Gauntlet

Limaria embodies militant pride and martial excellence, positioned north-central in Excelsia with a continental climate featuring harsh winters and temperate summers. The capital Silvercrest houses renowned warrior academies producing elite cavalry and armories forging enchanted weapons. King Patrick governs with absolute authority, his Red Legion enforcing order through strength. The economy thrives on mercenary contracts, with Red Legion units frequently deployed abroad under royal contract to neighboring realms in exchange for resources and political influence. During such deployments, Limaria maintains 15,000 auxiliary forces—a rotating pool of foreign mercenaries, retired legionnaires, and militia—to garrison secondary fortifications and train recruits. This creates a military economy where Limarian professional soldiers earn premium rates abroad while cheaper foreign contractors handle domestic security, generating net positive revenue for the kingdom. During foreign deployments, Limaria maintains 10,000 elite Silver Shields—veteran legionnaires rotated from front-line duty—to garrison critical fortifications while training new recruits. This creates a sustainable military economy where experienced soldiers train the next generation while earning premium rates abroad.
