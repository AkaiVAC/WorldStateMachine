# Kingdom of Zyronia - The Wild Realm

Zyronia is the tropical southern kingdom with a beast-folk majority (60% of population) organized as a tribal confederation. Occupying the continent's southernmost territories, Zyronia borders the Jade Sea to the south and extends to the southern edge of habitable Excelsian lands, beyond which lie uncharted waters and rumored unexplored continents. The lush realm enjoys warm, humid weather with abundant rainfall nourishing verdant jungles and savannas. Zyronia exports exotic spices, rare animal pelts, and unique magical artifacts prized across Excelsia. The kingdom fiercely resists Ilarian cultural expansion, viewing it as imperialistic encroachment on their traditional ways of life. Beast-folk culture emphasizes community, connection to nature, and respect for ancestral traditions. Zyronia welcomes outsiders cautiously while protecting their homeland's independence. The tribal confederation governance allows for local autonomy while presenting a united front against external threats, particularly Ilaria's expansionist policies. Zyronia's military relies on guerrilla tactics and knowledge of their difficult terrain, making conquest prohibitively expensive for would-be invaders.
