# Kingdom of Lindward - The Jeweled Crown

Lindward is a prosperous merchant principality in the northeast, known for opulent trade in luxury goods—pearls, gemstones, fine woods, and military supplies prized across the continent. The capital Regala glitters with merchant wealth and refined culture. Young King Michael rules after his parents' sudden deaths four years ago. Having weathered the initial succession crisis through decisive action and merchant guild support, he now faces ongoing noble factions seeking to exploit his youth and relative inexperience. The kingdom remains economically stable due to its diversified trade portfolio, though political uncertainty occasionally causes merchant anxiety. Lindward maintains careful diplomatic balance, trading material riches for political security through economic alliances with the Three Great Kingdoms. The kingdom's strategic position between Stuttgart, Sunnaria, and Lumia makes it both vulnerable and influential. Lindward's merchant guilds wield significant political power, often operating as independent diplomatic entities with their own foreign policies and intelligence networks.
