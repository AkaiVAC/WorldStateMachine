# Kingdom of Sunnaria - The Golden Delta

Sunnaria occupies the central position in Excelsia, bordering six other kingdoms and serving as the continent's primary trade hub. The kingdom enjoys a Mediterranean climate with warm, dry summers and mild, wet winters. Its capital Sunndor sits at the confluence of the Golden Rivers delta, making it a bustling merchant metropolis. Sunnaria maintains strict neutrality and excels at diplomacy, with King Alaric ruling wisely alongside Queen Elara. The 'Golden Rivers' system comprises the mighty Aurelian River and eight major tributaries that converge at Sunndor, forming a delta that reaches the Inner Sea. Five tributaries flow from northern and eastern kingdoms, while three drain southern and western regions, making Sunndor the natural geographic center of continental trade. The economy thrives on river trade tolls, spice route monopolies, and agricultural exports. These tolls are carefully calibrated—high enough to generate substantial revenue but low enough to remain cheaper than alternative routes. Sunnaria maintains this delicate balance to preserve its position as the preferred trade hub rather than encouraging kingdoms to develop competing infrastructure. The kingdom's military focuses on defense and trade route protection rather than expansion.
