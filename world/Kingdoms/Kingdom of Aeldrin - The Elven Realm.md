# Kingdom of Aeldrin - The Elven Realm

Aeldrin is the elven forest realm in the northwest, hidden within the ancient Silverwood Forest with a temperate climate of mild summers and crisp autumns. The elves maintain careful neutrality in continental politics, their long lives giving them perspective on the fleeting ambitions of human kingdoms. Aeldrin's exports include prized timber, exquisite elven-crafted goods, and rare magical herbs gathered from the deepest parts of the forest. The kingdom maintains an ancient pact with Ironforge, creating a powerful elven-dwarven alliance that has endured for centuries. While isolationist by nature, Aeldrin remains friendly toward neighboring kingdoms and occasionally mediates disputes through its long-term diplomatic perspective. Elven culture emphasizes patience, artistry, and connection to natural magic, with governance by a council of elders rather than absolute monarchy.
