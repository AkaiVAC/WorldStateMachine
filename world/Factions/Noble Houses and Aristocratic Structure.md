# Noble Houses and Aristocratic Structure

Each kingdom maintains distinct noble hierarchies with varying degrees of power and privilege. Sunnaria's nobility emphasizes merchant wealth and diplomatic skill, with houses often tracing lineage to successful traders who gained royal favor. Limaria's aristocracy revolves around military achievement, with noble titles frequently awarded for battlefield valor. Stuttgart's meritocratic system allows commoners to earn nobility through service, though old bloodlines still wield significant influence. Ilaria's elven nobility claims ancient lineage predating human settlement, creating tension with newer noble houses. Lunaria's matriarchal system means only women inherit titles and property, with male nobles serving as military commanders or consorts. Lindward's merchant princes blend commercial and aristocratic power, often wealthier than the royal family itself. Aeldrin's elven nobility governs through council rather than monarchy, emphasizing wisdom and magical prowess. Ironforge's dwarven clans function as both family and political units, with clan elders wielding authority. Zyronia's tribal chieftains combine spiritual and political leadership within the beast-folk confederation.
