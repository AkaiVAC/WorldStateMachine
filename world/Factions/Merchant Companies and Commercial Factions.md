# Merchant Companies and Commercial Factions

Powerful merchant organizations rival noble houses in wealth and influence across Excelsia. The Golden Rivers Consortium controls Sunnaria's trade network, its leaders possessing fortunes that dwarf many royal treasuries. Lindward's Jeweled Crown Guild monopolizes luxury goods, with members sitting on the royal advisory council and influencing foreign policy. The Ironforge Trade Compact represents dwarven commercial interests, negotiating mountain pass access terms that affect entire kingdoms' economies. Lunaria's Silver Tide Company dominates maritime trade with a fleet second only to the royal navy. These organizations maintain private armies, intelligence networks, and diplomatic channels independent of royal authority. Merchant conflicts can trigger economic warfare affecting common citizens, while company alliances often precede political marriages or military pacts. Many noble families maintain guild memberships or business partnerships, blurring traditional aristocratic-commercial distinctions. The growing power of merchant factions challenges traditional feudal structures, particularly in commercially-oriented kingdoms like Sunnaria and Lindward.
