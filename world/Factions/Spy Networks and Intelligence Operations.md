# Spy Networks and Intelligence Operations

Every major kingdom maintains sophisticated intelligence networks to protect national interests and gather information on rivals. Ria's organization in Sunnaria focuses on diplomatic intelligence and economic espionage, using the kingdom's central position to monitor all neighboring realms. Emelda Voss's network in Stuttgart emphasizes military intelligence and counter-espionage, reflecting the kingdom's security concerns. Ilaria combines traditional spies with magical surveillance through scrying and divination. Lindward's merchant guilds operate their own commercial intelligence services, often more effective than royal spies at economic matters. These networks employ diverse agents including diplomats, merchants, servants, and even magical constructs. Information trading between networks creates complex webs of mutual interest and blackmail potential. The most valuable intelligence typically concerns military movements, economic policies, succession plans, and magical research breakthroughs.
