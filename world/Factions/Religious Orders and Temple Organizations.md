# Religious Orders and Temple Organizations

The Seven Divine each maintain religious orders that serve their domains across Excelsia. Solarius's Order of the Golden Sun emphasizes justice, law, and solar magic, often serving as royal advisors and judges. Lunara's Silver Veil focuses on lunar magic, mysteries, and arcane knowledge, maintaining libraries and observatories. Ilarien's Scribes of Wisdom preserve knowledge, prophecy, and historical records in great libraries. Valorax's Iron Brotherhood trains warrior-priests who serve as military chaplains and honor guards. Mercuros's Traveling Guild facilitates communication, trade, and diplomatic exchanges between kingdoms. Silvanna's Green Wardens protect nature, sacred groves, and maintain balance between civilization and wilderness. Forgefather's Stonehand Clan combines religious devotion with master craftsmanship in dwarven temples. These orders maintain some independence from royal authority while serving kingdom interests. Tensions sometimes arise between orders serving different deities, particularly between Solarius's lawful approach and Lunara's mysterious traditions, or between Valorax's martial focus and Silvanna's peaceful nature worship.
