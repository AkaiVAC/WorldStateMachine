# Mercenary Companies and Contract Warfare

Mercenary companies form an essential component of Excelsia's military landscape, particularly for kingdoms lacking large standing armies. The Red Legion remains the most prestigious contractor, but numerous smaller companies operate across the continent. The Iron Wolves of Stuttgart specialize in northern warfare and siege operations. The Silver Serpents based in Sunnaria provide elite bodyguard and intelligence services. The Jade Tigers from Zyronia offer jungle warfare expertise and scout units. Mercenary contracts typically include monthly pay, equipment maintenance, casualty compensation, and victory bonuses. Successful company captains can accumulate substantial wealth and political influence, sometimes receiving noble titles or land grants. The mercenary trade creates complex loyalties, as companies maintain relationships with multiple kingdoms simultaneously. Recent years have seen increased competition and consolidation, with larger companies absorbing smaller rivals and expanding their service portfolios to include magical support and naval operations.
