# Border Disputes and Current Flashpoints

Several ongoing border disputes create persistent military tensions across Excelsia. The Limaria-Stuttgart conflict centers on the Great Lake's northern shores and surrounding fertile lands, with periodic skirmishes over fishing rights and territorial control. Ilaria's expansion creates friction along its borders with Zyronia and Sunnaria, as elven settlements gradually encroach on traditional territories. The Silverwood Forest's edges see occasional conflicts between Aeldrin's border patrols and human loggers or settlers. Ironforge maintains strict control over its mountain passes, sometimes clashing with merchants attempting to bypass tolls through dangerous alternative routes. These disputes rarely escalate into full-scale war due to the Three Great Kingdoms Alliance's stabilizing influence and the economic interdependence created by continental trade networks. However, they provide constant employment for mercenaries and test the diplomatic skills of rulers like King Alaric of Sunnaria, who often mediates such conflicts. The Limaria-Stuttgart conflict centers on the Great Lake's northern shores, where approximately 50 square kilometers of contested fertile land supports 8,000 civilians of mixed loyalty. Skirmishes occur 2-3 times annually, typically involving 100-500 soldiers and causing 10-30 casualties each. Both kingdoms maintain this 'controllable conflict' to satisfy martial honor while avoiding full-scale war that would draw alliance interventions.
