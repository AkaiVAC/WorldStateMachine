# Limaria's Red Legion - Military Foundation

The Red Legion represents Limaria's military backbone and primary export commodity. Numbering 25,000 professional soldiers at full strength, the Legion maintains constant readiness through rigorous training and competitive recruitment. Organization includes heavy infantry legions, cavalry wings, archer companies, and specialized siege units. The Legion's distinctive crimson armor and banners serve both practical identification and psychological warfare purposes. Beyond national defense, Limaria contracts Legion units as mercenaries to other kingdoms, generating substantial revenue that funds the kingdom's economy. Legion service offers social mobility for commoners, with distinguished veterans often receiving land grants and noble titles. The Legion's reputation for reliability and effectiveness makes its contracts highly sought after, though recent competition from Stuttgart's growing military industry threatens this economic advantage. Queen Elizabeth's command of the Silver Shields, the Legion's elite royal guard unit, demonstrates the royal family's personal commitment to martial excellence.
