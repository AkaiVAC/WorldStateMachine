# Ilarian Grand Academy - Premier Magical Institution

The Ilarian Grand Academy stands as Excelsia's oldest and most prestigious magical institution, founded over 800 years ago during the early elven settlement of Ilaria. Located in the capital Iluminara, the academy combines ancient elven magical traditions with systematic human learning methods. Admission requires demonstrating at least Circle 1 potential and passing rigorous entrance examinations covering mathematics, languages, and magical theory. The curriculum spans seven years for basic mastery, with advanced studies available for promising graduates. Specializations include protective wards, holy magic aligned with Ilarien, elemental manipulation, and theoretical magic. The academy's library contains priceless ancient texts, including some predating human settlement in Excelsia. Graduates typically enter royal service, establish private practices, or join Ilaria's expansion efforts as magical support. The academy's reputation for excellence attracts students from across the continent, though non-elves face higher tuition and limited access to certain advanced courses.
