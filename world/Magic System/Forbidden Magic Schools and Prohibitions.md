# Forbidden Magic Schools and Prohibitions

Certain magical practices face prohibition or strict regulation across most kingdoms due to their dangerous nature or ethical concerns. Necromancy involving soul manipulation or conscious undead creation remains universally banned. Blood magic that harms sentient beings for power extraction faces severe penalties. Mind control magic violating free will is restricted outside specific judicial or therapeutic contexts. Reality-altering spells with unpredictable consequences require special licenses. Temporal magic attempting to alter past events is theoretically impossible but research continues under tight controls. These prohibitions stem from historical disasters, ethical considerations, and practical concerns about magical stability. Enforcement varies by kingdom, with Ilaria maintaining the strictest magical regulations and remote regions sometimes tolerating forbidden practices. Underground markets for forbidden magical knowledge exist but carry extreme risks from both legal authorities and the magic itself. Most magical academies teach about forbidden arts theoretically to ensure graduates can recognize and counter them, though practical instruction remains prohibited.
