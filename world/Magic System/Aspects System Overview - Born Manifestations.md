# Aspects System Overview - Born Manifestations

Aspects are rare innate magical manifestations that occur in approximately 1 in 1,000,000 individuals (~40 people across Excelsia), granting unique born abilities that manifest at puberty. Aspect-bearers are even rarer than Circle 4 mages, with many dying young due to uncontrolled manifestations, being killed by fearful communities, or living in hiding. Scholars estimate that only half of those born with Aspects survive to adulthood and publicly acknowledge their nature, making confirmed Aspect-bearers extraordinarily rare—legendary figures whose names enter historical records. Known Aspect-bearers often become historical figures of legend. Unlike Circle magic which requires training, Aspects are born talents that don't count toward Circle progression but can combine with trained magical ability. Major Aspects include Void (manipulation of emptiness and negation), Mirror (reflection and duplication), Eternal Flame (undying fire and purification), Living Shadow (darkness manipulation and stealth), Blood (life force and connection), Truth (discernment and compulsion), Wanderer (travel and navigation), Beauty (attraction and illusion), Witness (memory and observation), and Entropy (decay and change). Aspect manifestation typically occurs during emotional or physical stress, sometimes causing temporary disruption before control develops. Aspect-bearers often face social reactions ranging from reverence to fear, depending on the Aspect's nature and local cultural attitudes. Some kingdoms actively recruit Aspect-bearers for special roles, while others monitor them cautiously due to their unpredictable power.
