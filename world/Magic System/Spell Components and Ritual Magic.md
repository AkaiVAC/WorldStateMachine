# Spell Components and Ritual Magic

Magic in Excelsia often requires physical components, verbal incantations, and somatic gestures, with complexity increasing with spell power. Material components range from common herbs and minerals for basic spells to rare substances like dragon scales, phoenix feathers, or starlight-infused crystals for powerful magic. Verbal components use specific languages or magical syllables that shape mana, while somatic gestures direct energy flow. Ritual magic involves extended ceremonies, multiple participants, and elaborate preparations for effects beyond individual spellcasting capacity. Different magical traditions emphasize various components: elven magic favors natural materials and melodic incantations, dwarven rituals use geometric patterns and resonant crystals, human spellcasting balances practicality with theoretical precision, and beast-folk magic incorporates primal elements and instinctive movements. Component availability influences regional magical specialization, with coastal areas excelling in water magic and mountain regions mastering earth spells. The trade in magical components represents a significant economic sector, with guilds regulating quality and preventing exploitation of rare creatures or environments.
