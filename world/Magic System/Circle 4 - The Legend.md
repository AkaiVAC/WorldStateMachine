# Circle 4 - The Legend

Circle 4 represents legendary achievement with approximately 15-25 individuals across Excelsia, each a strategic asset to their kingdom. Advancement requires profound magical breakthroughs or exposure to ancient power sources. Capabilities include annihilating armies with elemental cataclysms, creating permanent magical constructs, resurrection of the recently dead (within hours), perfect shapeshifting, teleportation across hundreds of miles, dimensional pocket creation, permanently altering an individual's nature, mass mind control affecting hundreds, crafting legendary artifacts, and manipulating probability fields. Fourth Circle mages require no components—pure will manifests their desires. The extreme rarity of Circle 4 advancement—even among elves who live 600-800 years and dedicate centuries to magical study—suggests that reaching this Circle requires not just time and effort but fundamental breakthroughs in magical understanding that cannot be taught or reliably achieved. Most scholars believe Circle 4 represents a threshold where innate talent, rare insights, and perhaps destiny converge, explaining why fewer than one in ten thousand dedicated mages ever cross it.
