# Magical Artifacts - Creation and Rarity

Magical artifacts range from common enchanted tools to legendary items of immense power. Creation requires skilled enchanters, rare materials, and significant magical energy. Common artifacts include ever-burning lanterns, self-cleaning garments, and minor healing potions available to wealthy citizens. Uncommon items feature weapons with elemental properties, communication devices, and protective amulets used by adventurers and military officers. Rare artifacts encompass flying vessels, scrying mirrors, and resurrection stones accessible only to royalty or powerful institutions. Legendary items like reality-altering staves, immortality elixirs, or city-scale protective wards exist primarily in myth or carefully guarded royal vaults. Artifact creation follows specific traditions: elven items emphasize harmony with nature, dwarven artifacts focus on durability and practical enhancement, human creations balance multiple functions, and beast-folk items channel primal energies. The most powerful artifacts often carry curses, limitations, or sentience that makes them dangerous to wield. Legal trade in magical items faces strict regulation to prevent dangerous objects from causing public harm.
