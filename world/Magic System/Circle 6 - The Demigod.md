# Circle 6 - The Demigod

Circle 6 represents power approaching divinity with 0-1 possibly alive today, more legend than confirmed fact. These beings blur the line between mortal mage and lesser deity. Capabilities include continental-scale reality alteration, perfect resurrection of anyone who has ever lived, creating entirely new species, opening permanent portals between dimensions, rewriting laws of physics within domains, granting or stripping magical power from others, perfect precognition, manifesting in multiple locations simultaneously, generating or destroying souls, and commanding legions of summoned entities. Sixth Circle entities exist partially outside normal time and space, perceiving past, present, and future simultaneously. The uncertainty surrounding Circle 6+ existence fuels philosophical debate: are these beings deliberately hidden, do they transcend physical reality entirely, or does the exponential difficulty make advancement beyond Circle 5 effectively impossible for mortal beings?
