# Mana Theory and Magical Mechanics

Mana represents the fundamental magical energy permeating Excelsia, flowing through all living beings and the environment. Theoretical models describe mana as both particle and wave, with different schools emphasizing various aspects. Personal mana reserves regenerate naturally but can be exhausted through overuse, causing magical burnout. Environmental mana concentrations create 'ley lines' and 'mana wells' that enhance spellcasting in specific locations. Magical ability depends on both innate mana sensitivity and trained capacity to channel and shape energy. Different races interact with mana distinctively: humans display versatile manipulation, elves achieve precise control through long practice, dwarves channel mana through physical materials, and beast-folk access primal mana flows instinctively. Advanced magical theory explores mana's relationship with consciousness, emotion, and reality itself. Practical applications include mana storage devices, amplification crystals, and containment fields for dangerous magical phenomena. Understanding mana mechanics enables more efficient spellcasting, magical item creation, and protection against hostile magic.
