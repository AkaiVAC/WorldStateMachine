# Major Trade Routes and Transportation Networks

The Golden Rivers represent Sunnaria's network of nine major river routes converging at Sunndor, carrying goods from all directions and generating substantial toll revenues. The Northern Route connects Stuttgart's mineral exports with southern markets. Western Routes carry Aeldrin's timber and elven goods to central kingdoms. Eastern Routes bring Lumia's exotic spices and religious artifacts. Southern Routes channel Zyronia's tropical products northward. Ironforge's Mountain Passes through the Thunderpeaks provide critical overland alternatives to sea routes, with dwarven caravans transporting precious metals and masterwork weapons. Maritime Networks see Lunaria dominating western sea lanes while Lindward controls eastern ocean commerce. Secret dwarven trade tunnels bypass surface routes during conflicts, providing Ironforge with strategic economic independence.
