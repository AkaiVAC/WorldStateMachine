# Currency Systems and Economic Exchange

Excelsia uses a standardized currency system based on gold pieces (gp), silver pieces (sp), and copper pieces (cp) with 100 copper equaling 10 silver equaling 1 gold. Most kingdoms mint their own coins with royal portraits but maintain consistent weight and purity standards to facilitate trade. Lindward's coins are particularly prized for their artistic quality and consistent purity. Merchant guilds often use letters of credit and trade notes for large transactions, reducing the need to transport heavy coinage. Barter remains common in rural areas and for specific goods like military service or magical components. Economic disparities exist between kingdoms: Lindward's luxury trade generates immense wealth, while Stuttgart's mineral riches fund military expansion, and Zyronia's spice monopolies provide economic leverage despite political vulnerability.
