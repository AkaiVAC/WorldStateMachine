# Continental Trade Networks and Economic Interdependencies

Excelsia's economy operates through interconnected trade networks that bind the eight kingdoms together. The Golden Rivers system centered in Sunnaria serves as the primary trade artery, with river tolls funding the central kingdom's prosperity. Ironforge controls critical mountain passes that serve as essential overland routes, charging premium rates for faster transport. Lindward dominates luxury goods markets with pearls, gemstones, and fine woods flowing through its merchant guilds. Zyronia's exotic spices travel north through established routes, while Lunaria's naval superiority allows it to tax maritime trade. Economic dependencies create political leverage: Stuttgart requires food imports, Limaria exports mercenaries, and Lumia leverages spiritual authority for favorable terms. Trade disruptions from Ilaria's expansion or Limaria-Stuttgart conflicts threaten continental stability. Ironforge's mountain pass tolls average 8-12% of cargo value for standard goods, 15-20% for luxury items—rates that kingdoms grudgingly pay while continually seeking alternatives. Successful competing routes include Lindward's Eastern Sea Route (adding 2 weeks but avoiding 5% Lunarian naval taxes) and Stuttgart's Northern Coastal Path (seasonal but toll-free).
