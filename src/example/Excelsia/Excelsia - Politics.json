Sunnaria typically follows primogeniture with flexibility for demonstrated diplomatic or commercial ability. Limaria emphasizes martial capability, with inheritance sometimes passing to the most militarily competent child regardless of birth order. Stuttgart's meritocratic system allows rulers to designate successors based on achievement rather than bloodline alone. Ilaria's elven nobility considers both lineage and magical attainment over centuries-long perspectives. Lunaria's matriarchal system passes all property and titles through female lines exclusively. Lindward often sees inheritance determined by business acumen and wealth management skills. Aeldrin's elven council system balances hereditary claims with demonstrated wisdom and magical harmony. Ironforge's dwarven clans use complex systems considering craft mastery, clan loyalty, and traditional rights. Zyronia's tribal confederation typically follows charismatic leadership and demonstrated ability to maintain tribal harmony. These systems create different succession dynamics, with some kingdoms experiencing stable transitions while others face frequent disputes or require royal intervention to resolve inheritance conflicts.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"Politics","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":false,"matchWholeWords":false,"useGroupScoring":false,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]},"displayIndex":101,"keysecondary":[],"outletName":""},"102":{"uid":102,"key":["diplomatic","royal","etiquette","state","ceremony","court","official","diplomatic protocols","royal etiquette","state ceremonies","diplomacy rules","court etiquette","official procedures"],"comment":"Diplomatic Protocols and Royal Etiquette","content":"Complex diplomatic protocols govern interactions between kingdoms, designed to prevent offense and facilitate negotiation. Royal audiences follow strict hierarchies based on kingdom status, with the Three Great Kingdoms receiving precedence. Gift exchanges carry symbolic meaning, with inappropriate gifts potentially causing diplomatic incidents. Language use in formal diplomacy requires careful attention to titles, honorifics, and traditional formulas. Ceremonial dress follows kingdom-specific traditions while respecting host customs. Negotiation procedures include preliminary meetings, formal presentations, private discussions, and treaty signings with witnessed oaths. Conflict resolution typically involves neutral mediation, often by Sunnaria given its central position and diplomatic reputation. Breaches of protocol range from minor social awkwardness to serious insults requiring formal apology or compensation. Younger diplomats and royals receive extensive training in multiple kingdoms' customs to prevent unintentional offenses. These protocols have evolved over centuries of interaction, incorporating elements from all major cultures while maintaining distinct kingdom identities. Mastery of diplomatic etiquette represents a valuable skill for nobles and officials operating in international contexts.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"Politics","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":false,"matchWholeWords":false,"useGroupScoring":false,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]},"displayIndex":102,"keysecondary":[],"outletName":""},"103":{"uid":103,"key":["marriage","custom","political","wedding","alliance","marriage customs","royal marriages","political alliances","wedding traditions","marriage politics","alliance marriages"],"comment":"Marriage Customs and Political Alliances","content":"Marriage serves both personal and political purposes across Excelsia, with customs varying significantly by kingdom. Royal marriages typically involve extensive negotiations regarding dowries, inheritance rights, and political implications. Sunnaria's diplomatic marriages often involve multiple smaller alliances rather than single major unions. Limaria's warrior culture emphasizes martial compatibility alongside political considerations. Stuttgart's meritocratic approach sometimes sees royals marrying accomplished commoners. Ilaria's elven marriages consider centuries-long political implications and magical bloodlines. Lunaria's matriarchal system means royal husbands typically come from subordinate positions. Lindward's merchant princes often marry for economic advantage and business connections. Cross-kingdom marriages require navigating different legal systems, religious traditions, and cultural expectations. Marriage contracts specify rights, responsibilities, and succession arrangements in meticulous detail. Failed political marriages can create diplomatic crises, while successful ones build enduring alliances. The children of international marriages often serve as cultural bridges but may face challenges regarding their identity and loyalties. Marriage remains one of the most powerful tools for building and maintaining political relationships between kingdoms.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"Politics","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":false,"matchWholeWords":false,"useGroupScoring":false,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]},"displayIndex":103,"keysecondary":[],"outletName":""},"104":{"uid":104,"key":["succession","inheritance","throne","lineage","royal","crown","succession rules","royal succession","throne inheritance","crown inheritance","throne rules","royal lineage"],"comment":"Succession Rules and Royal Disputes","content":"Royal succession follows kingdom-specific rules that balance hereditary claims with practical considerations. Most human kingdoms use primogeniture with variations: Sunnaria allows designation of competent heirs, Limaria considers military capability, Stuttgart incorporates meritocratic elements, and Lindward weighs economic skill. Ilaria's elven monarchy combines bloodline with magical attainment and council approval. Lunaria's matriarchal system passes the crown through female lines exclusively. Aeldrin's elven council selects rulers based on wisdom and magical harmony rather than strict heredity. Ironforge's dwarven throne follows clan leadership traditions. Zyronia's tribal confederation uses charismatic selection. Succession disputes represent ongoing political challenges, with current tensions in Lindward where King Michael's youth has led to the establishment of a Regent's Council including senior nobles and merchant guild leaders to ensure stability during his minority. Clear succession rules prevent conflicts, while ambiguous situations invite manipulation by internal factions and external powers. Royal families often maintain detailed genealogical records and succession plans, though unexpected deaths, disputed paternity, or sudden abdications can create instability. The Three Great Kingdoms Alliance sometimes mediates succession disputes to prevent wider conflicts.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"Politics","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":false,"matchWholeWords":false,"useGroupScoring":false,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]},"displayIndex":104,"keysecondary":[],"outletName":""},"105":{"uid":105,"key":["court","intrigue","manipulation","political","politics","scheme","game","court intrigue","political manipulation","royal politics","noble schemes","political games","court politics"],"comment":"Court Intrigue Mechanics and Political Manipulation","content":"Royal courts host complex political games where nobles, officials, and foreign agents maneuver for influence, wealth, and power. Information represents the primary currency, with spies, informants, and intercepted communications providing advantage. Alliance-building involves marriage proposals, business partnerships, shared enemies, and mutual benefit arrangements. Reputation management requires careful balancing of apparent strength with approachability. Favor trading creates networks of obligation that can be called upon during crises. Scandal manufacturing discredits rivals through true or fabricated revelations. Succession positioning involves supporting or undermining potential heirs based on future calculations. Foreign intelligence operations gather information while sometimes manipulating local politics for external advantage. Magical influence includes divination for advantage, enchantment for manipulation, and protective wards against hostile magic. Successful court players master multiple skills: social charm, strategic thinking, information analysis, risk assessment, and sometimes combat or magical ability for self-protection. The most dangerous players appear harmless while wielding significant influence through subtle manipulation rather than overt power.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"Politics","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":false,"matchWholeWords":false,"useGroupScoring":false,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"triggers":[],"characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]},"displayIndex":105,"keysecondary":[],"outletName":""}}}
