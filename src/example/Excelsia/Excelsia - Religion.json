The primary tension exists between Solarius's lawful order and Lunara's mysterious freedom, playing out in debates over magic regulation and social organization. Ilaria's claim of exclusive Ilarien favor conflicts with other kingdoms' assertions of equal divine attention. Disputes over interpretation of prophecies sometimes lead different temples to support conflicting political factions. Religious schisms occur when reform movements challenge traditional hierarchies or interpretations. Secular rulers sometimes clash with temple authorities over jurisdiction, particularly regarding magical crimes, moral legislation, or resource allocation. Most conflicts remain theological or political rather than violent, though historical religious wars inform current cautious approaches to inter-faith relations. The decentralized nature of Excelsian religion prevents continent-wide conflicts but allows localized tensions to develop.

True miracles typically occur during moments of extreme need, profound faith, or at holy sites during significant religious events. They manifest as healing beyond magical capacity, protection from certain doom, guidance in impossible situations, or manifestations of divine presence. Unlike spellcasting, miracles don't deplete personal mana but may require spiritual preparation, ritual purity, or specific conditions. Different deities manifest distinctively: Solarius provides clarity and protection, Lunara offers visions and mysteries, Ilarien grants wisdom and revelation, Valorax enables impossible victories, Mercuros facilitates crucial meetings, Silvanna enables communion with nature, and Forgefather inspires masterwork creation. Skeptics attribute miracles to unusual magical phenomena or psychological effects, while believers see direct divine action. Temple authorities carefully document and investigate claimed miracles to distinguish genuine divine intervention from magical accidents or fraud. The relationship between faith, magic, and actual divine presence remains one of Excelsia's great theological questions. Scholarly consensus holds that genuine miracles are extraordinarily rare—perhaps a dozen verified instances per century across all deities combined. Most attributed 'miracles' represent unusual but natural magical phenomena, psychological effects, or unrecognized magical intervention. This skeptical approach prevents fraudulent miracle claims from undermining religious authority while preserving space for genuine divine mystery.","constant":false,"vectorized":false,"selective":true,"selectiveLogic":0,"addMemo":true,"order":100,"position":0,"disable":false,"excludeRecursion":false,"preventRecursion":false,"delayUntilRecursion":false,"probability":100,"useProbability":true,"depth":4,"group":"Religion","groupOverride":false,"groupWeight":100,"scanDepth":null,"caseSensitive":false,"matchWholeWords":false,"useGroupScoring":false,"automationId":"","role":null,"sticky":0,"cooldown":0,"delay":0,"matchPersonaDescription":false,"matchCharacterDescription":false,"matchCharacterPersonality":false,"matchCharacterDepthPrompt":false,"matchScenario":false,"matchCreatorNotes":false,"ignoreBudget":false,"triggers":[],"displayIndex":100,"keysecondary":[],"outletName":"","characterFilter":{"isExclude":false,"names":[],"tags":[]}}}}
